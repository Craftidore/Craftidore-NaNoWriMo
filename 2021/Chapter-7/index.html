	<h1>Chapter 7</h1>
	<p class="subtitle">Sunday/Monday, November 6<sup>th</sup>/7<sup>th</sup>, UniYear 137 — Arc 1</p>
	<p>Wind whipping through her hair, Evelyn slammed the lab's front door open, finally breaking out of her stupor. Her bike would be the fastest mode of transportation, but she'd locked it to the bike rack, and the more time she spent undoing the lock, the more likely she'd lose Mr. Vacuum.</p>
	<p>"Parking the family car, hopping out, and staring at her, her father exclaimed "Evelyn, what's wrong?"</p>
	<p>"It's complicated," she responded. "Keys," she demanded, holding out your hand.</p>
	<p>"If you tell me what's going on first," her father insisted.</p>
	<p><em>It'll be faster to just unlock my bike</em> Evelyn decided. "Nevermind," she told him as she hopped onto her bike. "Just understand that I had a good reason," she said.</p>
	<p>She tried heading right, circling the block, trying to find a sign of Mr. Vacuum. Hailing the first pedestrian, a beggar, whose scent she detected long before she saw him, Evelyn demanded information on a backpack carrying, armband weilding stranger, slowing down but not stopping.</p>
	<p>"'E passed by," he told her, pointing in a direction.</p>
	<p>Bracing herself as the road grew rough and bumpy, Evelyn passed street after street, fearful to turn down them lest she get too far behind him, yet terrified that he had turned down one as yet uninvestigated.</p>
	<p>The road became a hill and Evelyn pressed on her brakes lightly. <em>I've missed him</em> she decided. Even with his head start, there was no way he'd outrun her. Turning around, she began investigating each side street, but gave up after four, as they were too time consuming to be productive.</p>
	<p class="sectionbreak">***</p>
	<p>
		Locking her bike outside her apartment building, Evelyn climbed the stairs passing one of her neighbors. "Hey," she said, "You're the new tenant, right?"
	</p>
</div>
<div class="page">
	<p>
		"Yup," Evelyn confirmed. 
	</p>
	<p>
		"Well, a guy stopped by. He's standing outside you're door," her neighbor responded. "Older, reddish brown beard," her neighbor added in response to Evelyn's confusion. Eyes widening, Evelyn rushed up the stairs.
	</p>
	<p>
		"There you are!" her father exclaimed, deep voice reverberating with anger. Thinking fast, Evelyn planned her lies.
	</p>
	<p>"A guy came in," she told him. <em>Technically true, if incomplete</em>. "He started messing with the machine," she continued. <em>That's still arguably true.</em> "I grabbed a coat rack," she said, mentally bracing herself as she gave up on half-truths. "I attacked him with it, but he kept dodging. The glass shattered after a couple of missed blows."</p>
	<p>"You hit the chamber, missing him," her father began, "and then you kept attacking, and broke it‽"</p>
	<p>"Yeah," Evelyn acknowledged, bowing her head in shame. "He ran out after that. After I got my wits back, I tried to follow him," she explained, finally back to half-truths. "That's why I wanted to borrow the keys, but I realized I didn't have time, and biked after him."</p>
	<p>"Courageous of you," her father acknowledged hesitantly. "I'm still very displeased. This was <em>six months</em> of your mom's and my work! I trusted you in there, that you'd be mature and responsible and <em>not</em> destroy the one piece of equipment we spent six months designing and building.</p>
	<p>"I'm sorry," Evelyn said. "But I don't regret my actions." She pushed past him, unlocked her front door, slamming it behind her as she entered.</p>
	<p class="sectionbreak">***</p>
	<p>Pushing her way past the dirty curtain, Evelyn wrinkled her nose at the overly flowery scent eminating from the nearby candles. She coughed involuntarily, shivering, and yelling "Kirk? I hope you're in today."</p>
	<p>"Here, deary!" he called, dropping the 'h' off the word. Shuffling out of a hallway, maneuvering past wobbling stacks of paper, a spry, wiry, old man popped into view, white hair (what little of it remained) bouncing.</p>
</div>
<div class="page">
	<p>"A man <em>probably</em> just showed up in town, though I can't confirm that he came in through usual means" Evelyn told him. "I need some basic information on him. Home town. Name if any. Whereabouts if you can. That sort of thing."</p>
	<p>"Are you sure you're boss will be fine with you spending fief money on my services?" Kirk asked. "You hired me last week too, and I'd hate to lose you as a customer, deary."</p>
	<p>"This is personal; no fief funding entering the picture."</p>
	<p>"I'd hate to know what this guy is to you that you're willing to blow your own money on <em>my</em> services. I don't offer discounts for personal requests y'know, not even the customers I like, like you deary."</p>
	<p>"I know; I've built myself a bit of a nest egg these past few months. I'll be fine."</p>
	<p>Shrugging, Kirk ran through his typical questionnaire, prying Evelyn's brain for details about this man. "You're not planning anything illegal here, right?" he asked. "It'd be a nightmare for my lawyer if the police found out I gave away information that led to a murder."</p>
	<p>"No," Evelyn denied. "I'm not going to…" she cut herself off, huffing. Taking a deep breath, she tried again. "I'm not a murderer and I don't plan on becoming one."</p>
	<p>"Good, good," Kirk muttered absently. Grabbing a sheet of paper off the nearest stack, he plopped onto the floor and read for half a minute, crumpled it up, and threw it into a pile of similarly crumpled sheets. He repeated the process another two times before noticing that Evelyn still stood there. "That's all I need from you, deary," he assured her. "I'm just reviewing reports now. I'll get back in touch with you when I find something or decide there's nothing to be found. We'll discuss my fee then."</p>
	<p>Evelyn turned to leave, then turned back. "Well, if you're going to contact me about this, you'll need to know—"</p>
	<p>"I know you moved," he said, cutting her off He rattled off the address. </p>
	<p>"How?"</p>
</div>
<div class="page">
	<p>Grinning and cocking an eyebrow at her, he said "information <em>is</em> my business after all," as if that explained everything. <em>And in a way</em> Evelyn thought, <em>it does.</em></p>
	<p class="sectionbreak">***</p>
	<p>As Evelyn arrived home, she spotted a 5" by 3" notecard sticking out of the door frame. It read "you are not welcome for dinner next Friday". Evelyn expected nonchalance, or even relief at not having to endure that torture next Friday, but the tears filling her eyes told a different story.</p>
