	<h1>Chapter 1</h1>
	<p>
		Typewriter clicking fiercely, Evelyn finished the final draft of her article with a joyous exclamation of "Done!" She grinned at the annoyed look of Arthur. Arthur's stubborn insistence to wear fancy clothes even on casual Fridays always drove her nuts, and she felt vindicated finishing ahead of him. "I stayed up late working on this last night." she soothed, explaining her speed. 
	</p>
	<p>"What's the topic?" Arthur asked. "Don't worry, I'm not going to try and steal the idea and take credit."</p>
	<p>"Well, you know how the consul from Cabu left the country in such a hurry?"</p>
	<p>"Yup. Everybody's got a theory why. Listening to the more outlandish conspiracy theories is sheer entertainment."</p>
	<p>"I got a meeting with one of the secretaries up in the capitol, and she helped me understand what happened. It was a simple disagreement, plain and simple, not worth the hype everyone has given it."</p>
	<p>Arthur typed in silence for a couple of seconds, mulling this over. "You know that won't sell. We adopted you into this fief on probation, but if you keep producing boring garbage like that, there is no way Lord Edward will let you stay."</p>
	<p>"It's not boring garbage!" Evelyn almost shouted, stomping out the door.</p>

		Evelyn biked down the empty streets of Domel, a unihour ahead of the rush. The wind blew trash across the dusty street. <em>The Hiij desperately need more funds</em> Evelyn reflected. <em>I'll have to bring that to Mother's attention.</em> She had time to kill and braked to a halt in front of a quaint cafeteria. "Lord Hasting! It's good to see you." Evelyn greeted the chef, locking her bike on the bike rack.
	</p>

<div class="page">
	<p>"You're early!" Hasting accused good-naturedly, his deep, gruff, and scratchy voice in sharp contrast with his scrawny build, heading peeking out the cafeteria stall.</p>
	<p>"I'm on time exactly" Evelyn countered jokingly. "I could never be <em>early</em>. All the clocks in the city must be wrong. It's the only reasonable explanation" she continued, laughing.</p>
	<p>"The usual?" Hasting queried.</p>
	<p>"Let's switch it up a bit," she announced, grinning. "I'll have the spicy rice-and-algae taco today.</p>
	<p>Hasting handed her the sandwich. "I loved your article about the various theories of healthy eating. It was absolutely fascinating."</p>
	<p>"I had to fight my boss tooth and nail to get him to let me publish it. He insisted the scope was too small, and the content boring."</p>
	<p>"You could transfer to another Lord," Hasting suggested.</p>
	<p>"I'm still only probationally a member of the Net fief. I need to seem loyal and willing to take things as they come if I want to gain permanent vassalship."</p>
	<p>"Net would be a fool to turn you away."</p>
	<p>"No fief can avoid foolish infighting and at least some self-destructive behavior. Believe me, we Netians know all about the stupid decisions fiefs make; those stories always sell best." Evelyn said, scarfing down the last three bites of her taco, and returning to her bike.</p>
	<p>"You're early, far before you get  off work, <em>and</em> you're in a hurry to leave. What's up?" Hasting asked as Evelyn unhooked her bike and started to ride off.</p>
	<p>"Interview to catch!" Evelyn shouted over her shoulder.</p>

	<!-- The point of this conversation is to throw out the idea of "the legends" of when humans had space travel -->

		Evelyn sat opposite a sharply dressed man, sporting cropped black hair, and nervously glancing around the living room. Evelyn preferred interviews in neutral locations, like coffee shops or parks. When interviewing someone in their own home, as this man had requested, it felt more like an invasion of privacy. "Sir, are you alright?" she asked. 
	</p>
	<p>He nodded jerkily. "I'm sorry, it just feels likeâ€¦ feels like I'm almost betraying my fief by talking about this," he explained.</p>
	<p>
		"I'm not going to give out any of the details of how your new telescope works. I wouldn't trick anyone into betraying their fief; I'm a reporter, not a monster." Evelyn soothed. "What inspired you to make a better telescope?" she asked.
	</p>
	<p>
		"I was working with Darpan Comp's mirrors, testing how light reflects when I wondered if these mirrors could be used to focus light. That was three years ago." the inventor droned as Evelyn scribbled notes furiously. 
	</p>
	<p>"How is the new telescope helping advance our knowledge of the universe?"</p>
	<p>
		"Well, there are about 20 times as many stars in the sky as we thought, based on what we could see with the old telescopes. Furthermore, some stars are fluctuating; the light they give out varies," he said, voice growing excited. Springing from his seat, crossing the room to a cabinet, he pulled out some hand-drawn charts, displaying them to Evelyn. "See, they follow a sine wave," he explained, pointing.
	</p>
	<p>
		"Fascinating" Evelyn muttered, taken aback by his sudden enthusiasm. She let him drone on for another couple of minutes, before interrupting with another question: "Will these discoveries impact the greater scientific community?"
	</p>
	<p>
		"Not really," he responded after a long pause. "Not for awhile, at least. Studying the stars won't be helpful until and unless we figure out how to travel among them like the legends tell of."
	</p>
	<p>"Thank you for your time," Evelyn concluded her interview.</p>

		The Mechan family house, a large, luxurious domicile, surrounded by a gate and an acre of land, brimming with energy, stood like a mountain, looming over Evelyn. Disgruntled, defensive, and even angry interviewees? those she could handle. Her family? Dealing with them took real bravery. <em>I can't stand here much longer</em> she reminded herself. She took a deep, calming breath, left her bike on the lawn, and marched to the door.
