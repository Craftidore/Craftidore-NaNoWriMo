	<h1>Chapter 1</h1>
	<p>
		Typewriter clicking fiercly, Evelyn finished the final draft of her article with a joyous exclamation of "Done!" She grinned at the annoyed look of Arthur. Arthur's stuborn insistance to wear fancy clothes even on casual fridays always drove her nuts, and she felt vindicated finishing ahead of him. "I stayed up late working on this last night." she soothed, explaining her speed. 
	</p>
	<p>"What's the topic?" Arthur asked. "Don't worry, I'm not going to try and steal the idea and take credit."</p>
	<p>"Well, you know how the consul from Cabu left the country in such a hurry?"</p>
	<p>"Yup. Everybody's got a theory why. Listening to the more outlandish conspiracy thoeries is sheer entertainment."</p>
	<p>"I got a meeting with one of the secretaries up in the capitol, and she helped me understand waht actually happened. It was a simple disagreement, plain and simple, not worth the hype everyone has given it."</p>
	<p>Arthur typed in silence for a couple of seconds, mulling this over. "You know that won't sell. We adopted you into this fief on probation, but if you keep producing boring garbage like that, there is no way Lord Edward will let you stay."</p>
	<p>"It's not boring garbage!" Evelyn almost shouted, stomping out the door.</p>

		Evelyn biked down the empty streets of Domel, an unihour ahead of the rush. Wind blew trash across the dusty street. <em>The Hiij desperately need more funds</em> Evelyn reflected. <em>I'll have to bring that to Mother's attention.</em> She had time to kill, and braked to a halt in front of a quaint cafeteria. "Lord Hasting! It's good to see you." Evelyn greeted the chef, locking her bike on the bike rack.

	<p>"You're early!" Hasting accused good-naturedly, his deep, gruff, and scratchy voice in sharp contrast with his scrawny build.</p>
	<p>"I'm on time exactly" Evelyn countered jokingly. "I could never be <em>early</em>. All the clocks in the city must be wrong. It's the only reasonable explanation" she continued, laughing.</p>
	<p>"The usual?" Hasting queried.</p>
	<p>"Let's switch it up a bit." she announced, grinning. "I'll have the spicy rice-and-algea taco today.</p>
	<p>Hasting handed her the sandwich. "I loved your article about the various theories of healthy eating. It was absolutely fascinating."</p>
	<p>"I had to fight my boss tooth and nail to get him to let me publish it. He insisted the scope was to small, and the content boring."</p>
	<p>"You could transfer to another Lord." Hasting suggested.</p>
	<p>"I'm still only probationally a member of the Net fief. I need to seem loyal and willing to take things as they come if I want to gain permanent vassalship."</p>
	<p>"Net would be a fool to turn you away."</p>
	<p>"No fief is able to avoid foolish infighting and at least some self-destructive behavior. Believe me, we Netians know all about the stupid decisions fiefs make; those stories always sell best." Evelyn said, scarfing down the last three bites of her taco.</p>
