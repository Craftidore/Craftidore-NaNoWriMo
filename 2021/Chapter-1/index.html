	<h1>Chapter 1</h1>

		Typewriter clicking fiercly, Evelyn finished the final draft of her article with a joyous exclamation of "Done!" She grinned at the annoyed look of Arthur. Arthur's stuborn insistance to wear fancy clothes even on casual fridays always drove her nuts, and she felt vindicated finishing ahead of him. "I stayed up late working on this last night." she soothed, explaining her speed.

	<p>"What's the topic?" Arthur asked. "Don't worry, I'm not going to try and steal the idea and take credit."</p>
	<p>"Well, you know how the consul from Cabu left the country in such a hurry?"</p>
	<p>"Yup. Everybody's got a theory why. Listening to the more outlandish conspiracy thoeries is sheer entertainment."</p>
	<p>"I got a meeting with one of the secretaries up in the capitol, and she helped me understand waht actually happened. It was a simple disagreement, plain and simple, not worth the hype everyone has given it."</p>
	<p>Arthur typed in silence for a couple of seconds, mulling this over. "You know that won't sell. We adopted you into this feif on probation, but if you keep producing boring garbage like that, there is no way Lord Edward will let you stay."</p>
	<p>"It's not boring garbage!" Evelyn almost shouted, stomping out the door.</p>
