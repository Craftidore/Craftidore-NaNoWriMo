	<h1>Chapter 5</h1>
	<p class="subtitle">Middle-Of-The-Night Friday/Saturday, November 11<sup>th</sup>, UniYear 137 — Arc 2</p>
	<p>Blinded by the sudden bright white light, Evelyn took an involuntary step backward, running into the gray wall of the interrogation room. "I'm sorry," the police officer on the other side of the table apologized. "The light puts people out of their comfort zone, making criminals more likely to tell the truth, or so the psychologists tell us." Evelyn didn't bother to respond, closing her eyes and willing the tears away. "Let's start with what you were doing before you found out they were gone."</p>
	<p>"I was b- borrowing the car for a- an interview," she replied, avoiding mention of Kient. "I was returning it when I saw the house."</p>
	<p>"Describe the house," he commanded.</p>
	<p class="sectionbreak">***</p>
	<p class="subtitle">Earlier That Day</p>
	<p>Kient walked side by side with Evelyn, eyes roaming the streets in search of any onlookers. "You can't mention me," he told her.</p>
	<p>"I have to lie to the police‽"</p>
	<p>"Not lie, just… leave out a few details. If you want to bring the culprits to justice, you'll have to. I'm a man with no ID, a face no one has seen before or will for a couple hundred years. I have no character references, no friends, and no one who can vouch for any alibi I gave, excluding you. It's a perfect setup from the cops' perspectives, They'll latch onto me, investigating me thoroughly before looking elsewhere. I don't blame them; I'm a prime suspect. Unfortunately, since I had nothing to do with this, they'd waste weeks. Whoever did this knew what they were doing. Even giving someone like that a week would be disastrous to the investigation."</p>

		Evelyn nodded. "I get the feeling you have personal reasons for wanting to stay off the radar, but that doesn't make you wrong," she said, acknowledging the elephant in the room. Her mind had entered into emotional shock, now unable to feel anything at all. They'd capitalized on her sudden jump in her analytical faculties.  
	</p>
	<p>
		"So, the house:" Kient continued, "downstairs there was a window taken out, likely a point of entry."
	</p>
	<p>"Downstairs a window was removed, it was big enough for someone to crawl in through," Evelyn confirmed.</p>
	<p>"The front porch caved in because of a sudden lack of structural support, which was caused by an explosion."</p>
	<p>"Something went 'kaboom,' and the front porch caved in," Evelyn repeated.</p>
	<p>"Right," Kient affirmed, satisfied she had her facts straight.</p>
	<p class="sectionbreak">***</p>
	<p>"The house," Evelyn answered, confidence increasing, "we arrived around twenty-hundred, light fading. The front porch was destroyed by an explosion."</p>
	<p>"Got it," the officer acknowledged. "Did you go inside?"</p>
	<p>"Y- Yes."</p>
	<p>"Take your time."</p>
	<p>"I ran upstairs first," Evelyn started. <em>It's certainly true</em> she assured herself. "That's where all the bedrooms are. It was about bedtime for my sisters, so I figured that's where they'd be."</p>
	<p>"Okay," the officer acknowledged, the word drawn out, puzzled expression adorning his face. "Then what?"</p>
	<p>"They were gone," Evelyn moaned, tears forming once more.</p>
	<p>"Hey there," the officer comforted. "Just tell me what happened next."</p>
</div>
<div class="page">
	<p class="sectionbreak">***</p>
	<p>"You're going to be emotionally distraught again soon, certainly by the time the police take your statement. Don't worry about sticking to a single topic. You can always mention details you forgot. It may be a bit easier for the police if it's all coherent and linear, but it also looks a bit suspicious."</p>
	<p class="sectionbreak">***</p>
	<p>"I cried, I- I don't know how long." <em>Still true</em>, she calmed herself. "Down- downstairs," she continued, "there was a window. I forgot about it. It was popped out of the frame, lying against the wall. 'T was one of those big panel windows. Seemed odd."</p>
	<p>"Odder than the wrecked front porch?" the officer questioned.</p>
	<p>"Odd because it wasn't wrecked, wasn't smashed, and wasn't thrown!" Evelyn shouted, voice losing its stutter.</p>
	<p>"Fine," he said. Evelyn stared at the police officer, suddenly distracted from her tragedy as the maxims she'd created flashed through her mind. <em>This idiot doesn't understand how people work. You should <em>never</em> challenge an interviewee on petty details. Always wait until she's built herself a house of cards that you can topple all at once!</em></p>
	<p class="sectionbreak">***</p>
	<p>"Look," Evelyn interrupted, "I don't think I can lie."</p>
	<p>"Avoid the full truth," Kient corrected.</p>
	<p>"Lie," Evelyn insisted. "I don't think I can lie to a police officer. I mean, they're <em>detectives</em>. What if I'm caught lying?"</p>
	<p>"You're a reporter!" he chuckled. "Think about how you'd lie to yourself."</p>
	<p>"That's <em>the worst</em> advice you've given me tonight," she accused.</p>
	<p>"You wait and see."</p>
	<p class="sectionbreak">***</p>
</div>
<div class="page">
	<p>"I- I was in my brother's room when I noticed the holes in the wall," Evelyn continued, stuttering intentionally this time. "They went clean through the wall," she continued, embellishing a few details. "And there was a knife. A knife stuck in the wall. My brother's knife." She didn't stop the tears this time.</p>
	<p>"I…" it was the officer's turn to stutter. "I think that's all I'll need for now. Please wait here while I call up the chief."</p>
	<p class="sectionbreak">***</p>
	<p>He returned 15 minutes later. "We're not taking your case," he told her.</p>
	<p>"But…" she started, halting as the shock hit her. "But they're gone!"</p>
	<p>"It's," the policeman couldn't find words. "Look, I think he was bribed. This guy came in two days ago, demanding to speak with the chief. I listened at the door, and they were whispering. Two days later, he tells me to ignore a case when there's clear evidence of wrongdoing."</p>
	<p>"Can't you report him?"</p>
	<p>"He's a Lord. The higher-ups would never believe me, and he'd make sure I got kicked out of the fief. No."</p>
	<p>"Can you help me find my family, just off-duty?"</p>
	<p>"Chief would know." They stood in awkward silence. "I can give you a description of the man who spoke with the chief," he finally decided. Pulling out his notebook, he scrawled for a minute, tore it off, and gave it to her.</p>
	<p class="sectionbreak">***</p>
	<p>"How'd it go?" Kient asked as they met up at 1:00 a couple of streets away.</p>
	<p>"They won't help. They aren't taking my case," explained Evelyn.</p>
	<p>"Impossible!" Kient declared.</p>
	<p>"The officer thinks the chief was bribed, but won't blow the whistle."</p>
</div>
<div class="page">
	<p>Kient, who had been walking by Evelyn's side, turned around, walking backward just ahead of her. "I bet you can find the culprit," he encouraged. "You found me, after all." They rounded a corner, the Mechan family car in sight.</p>
	<p>"Won't you help?"</p>
	<p>"I… I can't <em>interfere</em>," Kient explained.</p>
	<p>Evelyn stopped dead in her tracks, Kient walking a bit further before stopping with her. She stared past him, eyes almost glazed. "What's wrong?" he asked.</p>
	<p>"You'll call me insane."</p>
	<p>"I <em>know</em> you're insane," Kient countered. "I declare myself a time traveler and you don't even blink, you just take me at my word. It's not a great argument toward sanity."</p>
	<p>"The car," Evelyn said, pointing. "It turned <em>white</em>, then just disappeared."</p>
	<p>Kient didn't bother looking where her finger pointed, instead pacing in a circle, eyes glued to the street, repeating "No no no no no no."</p>
	<p>"What?"</p>
	<p>"How can time travel exist?" he questioned. "If you could change the past, it would be ever-mutating, never the same, a constant paradox. The past cannot be rewritten!" He paused his pacing. "We tested it, trying to go back and play events out differently than we remembered. If the change is small enough, say you go back in time, meet yourself, then repeat the speech you remembered giving yourself, word for word, changing only one word; the universe can handle the paradox. It has consequences though. Things will start disappearing just like the car did; little things at first, like pens and such, but as the difference between what should happen and what does gets bigger, so do the missing objects. We think, if I ever deviated from what happened drastically enough, the entire universe would collapse, or at least this solar system."</p>
</div>
<div class="page">
	<p>"If time travel is that dangerous, why would you ever do it?"</p>
	<p>"Not time traveling would cause the same armageddon as time traveling and changing the past, because refusing to time travel back would change the past."</p>
