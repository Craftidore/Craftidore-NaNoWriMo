	<h1>Chapter 2</h1>
	<p class="subtitle">One Week Later</p>
	<p>"I never did catch your name," the young lady, black hair loose, curls falling just below her shoulders, remarked, gaze flicking between him and her notebook. She sat in a ragged chair, upholstery torn and stained. It was the only chair in the baren room.</p>
	<p>Standing carefully, watching the doorway, sleeve pulled up revealing a bulky black arm band extending from elbow to wrist, Paatrick fiddled with it, trying to adjust it to a more comfortable position. "You didn't somehow fail to catch my name, I just didn't give it to you," he countered.</p>
	<p>"You <em>clearly</em> don't get how this works," the lady hazarded. "My name is Evelyn, fief Net," she intoned. "Now you try."</p>
	<p>"I don't have time for this!" he shouted, wincing as his arm band pinched him.</p>
	<p>"Do you know how long I've searched for you!" Evelyn shot back. "I'm not letting you leave until you answer my questions. You've caused nothing but chaos in my life, then I find someone trying to murder you, and then a city block burns down in your vicinity. And now that I've cornered you, I'm supposed to just <em>let you go</em>?"</p>
	<p>He stared at her, unblinking, for the better part of a minute before responding. "My name is Paatrick"</p>
	<p>"Patrick, eh? Nice name," she replied, pen suddenly active.</p>
	<p>"No, it's Paatrick" he said, stressing the double vowel.</p>
	<p>"Ok then. Where are you from?"</p>
	<p>"You don't want to know."</p>
	<p>"Humor me," Evelyn insisted.</p>
	<p>"You won't believe me."</p>\

<div class="page">
	<p>"I've watched you perform impossible acts, know things you had no business knowing, not to mention appearing out of thin air! Try me."</p>
	<p>"First of all, not thin air, it was a near-vacuum," Paatrick clarified. "I'm from about 300 years in your future."</p>
	<p>"How'd you wind up here?" Evelyn asked. "According to a scientist I interviewed a couple of years ago, time travel requires going faster than the speed of light, which is impossible."</p>
	<p>"The scientist was wrong," Paatrick stated flatly. "I don't know the details; I didn't invent this" he said, gesturing to his arm band, "'cause if I did, I would have made comfort a <em>far</em> higher priority." He adjusted the arm band further, before letting his arm fall to his side. The arm band was far heavier than it looked, and Paatrick found every excuse to rest his left arm, be that via a countertop or the back of a chair. "If there were more than one of these things, maybe my orders wouldn't have included 'Never, under any circumstances, remove the time travel device from your arm,' but that's not the reality we live in.</p>
