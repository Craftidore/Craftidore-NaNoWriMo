	<h1>Chapter 2</h1>
	<p class="subtitle">Friday, One Week Later, November 11<sup>th</sup>, UniYear 137 — Arc 2</p>
	<p>"I never did catch your name," the young lady, black hair loose, curls falling just below her shoulders, remarked, gaze flicking between him and her notebook. She sat in a ragged chair, upholstery torn and stained. It was the only chair in the baren room.</p>
	<p>Standing carefully, watching the doorway, sleeve pulled up revealing a bulky black armband extending from elbow to wrist, Kient fiddled with it, trying to adjust it to a more comfortable position. "You didn't somehow fail to catch my name, I just didn't give it to you," he countered.</p>
	<p>"You <em>clearly</em> don't get how this works," the lady hazarded. "My name is Evelyn, fief Net," she intoned. "Now you try."</p>
	<p>"I don't have time for this!" he shouted, wincing as his armband pinched him.</p>
	<p>"Do you know how long I've searched for you!" Evelyn shot back. "I'm not letting you leave until you answer my questions. You've caused nothing but chaos in my life, then I find someone trying to murder you, and then a city block burns down in your vicinity. And now that I've cornered you, I'm supposed to just <em>let you go</em>?"</p>
	<p>He stared at her, unblinking, for the better part of a minute before responding. "My name is Kient"</p>
	<p>"Kent, eh? Nice name," she replied, pen suddenly active.</p>
	<p>"No, it's 'Kee-ent'" he said, carefully stressing the difference.</p>
	<p>"Ok then. Where are you from?"</p>
	<p>"You don't want to know."</p>
	<p>"Humor me," Evelyn insisted.</p>
	<p>"You won't believe me."</p>
</div>
<div class="page">
	<p>"I've watched you perform impossible acts, know things you had no business knowing, not to mention appearing out of thin air! Try me," she challenged.</p>
	<p>"First of all, not thin air, it was a near-vacuum," Kient clarified. "I'm from about 300 uniyears in your future."</p>
	<p>"How'd you wind up here?" Evelyn asked. "According to a scientist I interviewed a couple of uniyears ago, time travel requires going faster than the speed of light, which is impossible."</p>
	<p>
		"The scientist was wrong," Kient stated flatly. "I don't know the details; I didn't invent this," he said, gesturing to his armband, "If I had, I would have made comfort a <em>far</em> higher priority." He adjusted the armband further, before letting his arm fall to his side. The band was far heavier than it looked, and Kient found every excuse to rest his left arm, be that via a countertop or the back of a chair. "If there were more than one of these things, maybe my orders wouldn't have included '<em>Never, under any circumstances, remove the time travel device from your arm,</em>' but that's not the reality we live in," he complained.
	</p>
	<p>
		"I'm so sorry," Evelyn replied sarcastically. "What's your purpose here?"
	</p>
	<p>
		"This is the first long-range test," he explained. "We've done some short-range jumps before; hours, sometimes a couple of days, once an entire month. We've never gone back into real history until now."
	</p>
	<p>
		"Does it work forwards in time too," Evelyn asked, "or are you stuck here?"
	</p>
	<p>
		"I'm not trapped here," Kient insisted, "but if I went back to my own time, I don't think I'll be able to get back to now."
	</p>
	<p>"Why would that be? You got here the first time. What makes a return trip different?"</p>
	<p>"It's… complicated."</p>
	<p>Evelyn sighed. "Alright, I'll return to that question later," she said, much to Kient's relief.</p>
</div>
<div class="page">
	<p>"You're not going to write an article about me, are you?" Kient asked, suddenly nervous as he remembered her occupation.</p>
	<p>"As much as my boss would love an article as absurd as this, no; I'd rather preserve my credibility."</p>
	<p>
		"What else do you have?"
	</p>
	<p>"I think that tides me over for now. I trust there is a place I can find you when I come up with more questions?"</p>
	<p>"Yes. I've struck a deal with a local mechanic. I help him out in his shop, and he gives me food and lodging." He rattled off the address, her pen furiously taking note.</p>
	<p class="sectionbreak">***</p>
	<p>Evelyn's eyes ran over the man who had caused so much chaos in her life, his grimy overalls making sense now. She glanced out the door at the foreign street. "We should probably head back," she said, gesturing to the car.</p>
	<p>He nodded. They got in with Evelyn driving and began the five-hour journey back to Evelyn's home city of Arack. "So what's it like in the future?" Evelyn interrupted after a few minutes of silence.</p>
	<p>"Things aren't great, at least not here on Ranaak" he replied.</p>
	<p>"Ranaak?" Evelyn asked, confused.</p>
	<p>"This planet," he explained. "After we ran into other inhabited planets, we had to find some way of differentiating between them. One country had taken over this planet at the time, a country called Ranaak, and so the planet got the designation as well."</p>
	<p>"So there are other inhabited planets out there?"</p>
	<p>"Correct. The ones we've found are Ruuli and Viivil. We're pretty sure they aren't the only other inhabited planets leftover though. Now, you people keep talking about 'fiefs.' What in the world do you mean? I've checked the dictionary and it says fiefs are parcels of land, owned by lords, usually with serfs or peasants living under them, but when I ask what land a particular fief consists of, I'm met with blank stares."</p>
</div>
<div class="page">
	<p>"I've never heard of that definition before; I wonder if the word got adapted later."</p>
	<p>"No, the dictionary I'm using is a copy of a relic we discovered from before the Rangaan war. It's certainly older than your country."</p>
	<p>"Huh," Evelyn grunted. "Fiefs here aren't about land. Instead, they are more… abstract branches of the economy. The Net fief mostly consists of journalists, book writers, and, nowadays at least, radio. In the original charter, Net was given dominion over information, be that news or media. Another example is the Hiij fief. The Hiij fief works on public services, establishments, etcetera."</p>
	<p>"So… is each fief like a business?" Kient asked.</p>
	<p>"I don't know what you mean."</p>
	<p>"A business is a group of people who collectively offer services or products for money. Like," he said, trying to come up with the right words. "Like," Kient repeated, "like, how much is each fief a part of the government, and how much of it is an autonomous organization?"</p>
	<p>"Depends on the fief," Evelyn answered, "but usually a fair bit of both. In each fief, there are five to twenty 'masters' and a couple hundred 'lords,' with the rest of us as Vassals. Everyone of 'lord' or higher has a vote in our government, weighted by dividing their vote by the number of their rank in the fief.</p>
	<p>"Not what I'm used to, but I suppose it makes sense. And how autonomous from the government are they?" he prompted.</p>
	<p>"Every Lord is in many ways independent to their fief. Each lord hires from inside their fief and sends a cut of whatever profits they make as fief taxes."</p>
	<p>"It sounds like every lord owns their own business," Kient commented.</p>
	<p>"I guess," Evelyn said, shrugging. They drove in silence for a couple of minutes.</p>
	<p>"What fief are you?" Kient spoke up.</p>
</div>
<div class="page">
	<p>"Well… Fiefs are normally hereditary. My mother and father are both under Gineer, who work on machinery and math and stuff." Evelyn grimaced as she reflected. "I've never been good at that sort of thing."</p>
	<p>"Oh."</p>
	<p>"There is a way to change fiefs. I pledged my loyalty to fief Net three uniyears ago, and I've been a journalist ever since. Unfortunately, when you transfer fiefs you become something of a second-class citizen. Worse, my mother is a lord in Gineer, so I'm a huge family embarrassment."</p>
	<p>They continued talking for a while, Evelyn seeking further details about the future as they drove. Kient contented to give her interesting details but refrained from talking about himself personally.</p>
	<p class="sectionbreak">***</p>
	<p>
		Evelyn slowed the car down as they approached the city of Arack. Transportation was rather limited, Kient noted. Neither highways nor mass public transit systems had been invented, and while cars were designed to brave the rough dirt "roads" (if they even deserved to be called that), it was still unimaginably slow. If there was one thing Kient missed about the future, it was the teleporters. "Your friend's mechanics shop is in the north quarter, right?" she asked.
	</p>
	<p>Snapping himself out of his trance, Kient nodded. "Is it inconvenient for you to drop me off?"</p>
	<p>"Kinda," Evelyn admitted.</p>
	<p>"Then I'll just walk."</p>
	<p>"Thank you," she said, relieved. "I need to drop the car off at my parents' house. I kinda-sort-of borrowed it without asking permission," she said, rushing through the admission as if that would take away its meaning.</p>
	<p>"Maybe <em>that's</em> why your mother doesn't like you," Kient suggested, eyebrows raised.</p>
	<p>"It was an emergency," Evelyn insisted, taking a sharp left as she reached the edge of the city.</p>
</div>
<div class="page">
	<p>"Uh-huh," he grunted skeptically. "And how many 'emergencies' have you found yourself in?"</p>
	<p>"Really just this one. When I need to get somewhere in the city, I just bike, and while sometimes an article will require an interview of someone in a neighboring city, Lord Edward, my boss, bought a car for us to use.</p>
	<p>The lane, cutting through trees, soon revealed her family's house. She braked as she pulled up to the gate, only to find it open. "I wonder if Flores left it like this," Evelyn hypothesized, driving through.</p>
	<p>"That's your thirteen-year-old brother, right?" Kient asked.</p>
	<p>"You paid a lot of attention," she replied.</p>
	<p>"I didn't have to; you are quite the engaging storyteller."</p>
	<p> Evelyn thought for a moment before saying "it's something of a job requirement."</p>
	<p>The car crested the hill of the estate, and she pulled to a stop in front of the porch. Staring, Evelyn examined the scene. A bomb must have gone off right outside the front door. Parts of the wall around the space previously occupied by a doorway had blown into the house, with the porch smashed outward, awning resting limply on the ground.</p>
	<p>"No, no, NO, <strong>NO!</strong>," Evelyn screamed as she sprang out of the car, sprinting for the doorway. "Mother‽ Flores‽ Ritti‽" she screamed, but none responded. Carefully climbing past the destroyed porch and through the missing doorway. Rushing upstairs, she inspected the bedrooms. Ritti and Enni's bedroom, lay unbothered, in its ever-pristine condition. Flores's had been ransacked, and not just from the life and times of a thirteen-year-old. A pocket knife with Flores's name stuck into the wall. She spotted gunshot holes in the walls, but she found no blood on the floor.</p>
	<p>Tears streaming from her face, Evelyn hesitantly checked the master bedroom, fearful of what she might find. Barren, the bed unmade, with her parents nowhere to be seen, it decimated what remained of her composure.</p>
	<p class="sectionbreak">***</p>
</div>
<div class="page">
	<p>Kient, kneeling on the floor of the mansion, for that's what Evelyn's family's house was, examined the wreckage. The bomb, he determined, was detonated after a break-in, as a carefully removed window in the back of the house had scuff marks, and made the most likely mode of entry. <em>Setting off an explosion like that would draw a lot of attention. Why would anyone set one-off…? unless it was a distraction. But if it were a distraction of some kind, why was there a break-in?</em> He steeled himself, looked around for the stairs Evelyn had disappeared up and strode up to the second floor.</p>
	<p>The sound of her weeping led him to the master bedroom. Prostrate on the bed, head buried in the pillows, Evelyn cried. "Hey" he spoke softly as he entered the room.</p>
	<p>"They're gone! And there're bullet holes! And his knife is stuck in the wall!" she sobbed.</p>
	<p>"Do you know what might have happened?" he asked, creeping toward the bed. She looked up, fully realizing his presence. She squeezed her eyes shut, trying to regain any degree of composure. </p>
	<p>"I… I don't know what happened. They…" she trailed off, gulping. "I could have been here," she suddenly insisted. "I could have stopped whatever it was."</p>
	<p>"What did you find here?" Kient asked. She walked him through what she found in each room. "Did your family have any plans yesterday?" he asked.</p>
	<p>"No," she replied. "I saw the lights on in the house when I borrowed mother's car." She sniffed, and a tear ran down her cheek</p>
	<p>"Ok, so unless they got up and left in the middle of the night, sometime before the house got trashed, they were probably kidnapped," Kient concluded. "You said your sisters' rooms were still clean, with no signs of a scuffle. I'm guessing they went after them first. From there they either went to the master bedroom, taking your parents, which then woke up your brother, who fought back, but whom they restrained without harming, or they encountered your brother next, fought, and used the captured children as bargaining chips to get your parents to cooperate."</p>
</div>
<div class="page">
	<p>"How can you know?"</p>
	<p>"I don't <em>know</em>, but I took some classes on criminal behavior at University, and this follows the same pattern as a lot of kidnappings," Kient explained. She nodded. "Should we contact the police," he asked, "or whatever you call the people who enforce law here."</p>
