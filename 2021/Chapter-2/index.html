	<h1>Chapter 2</h1>
	<p class="subtitle">One Week Later</p>
	<p>"I never did catch your name," the young lady, black hair loose, curls falling just below her shoulders, remarked, gaze flicking between him and her notebook. She sat in a ragged chair, upholstery torn and stained. It was the only chair in the baren room.</p>
	<p>Standing carefully, watching the doorway, sleeve pulled up revealing a bulky black arm band extending from elbow to wrist, Kient fiddled with it, trying to adjust it to a more comfortable position. "You didn't somehow fail to catch my name, I just didn't give it to you," he countered.</p>
	<p>"You <em>clearly</em> don't get how this works," the lady hazarded. "My name is Evelyn, fief Net," she intoned. "Now you try."</p>
	<p>"I don't have time for this!" he shouted, wincing as his arm band pinched him.</p>
	<p>"Do you know how long I've searched for you!" Evelyn shot back. "I'm not letting you leave until you answer my questions. You've caused nothing but chaos in my life, then I find someone trying to murder you, and then a city block burns down in your vicinity. And now that I've cornered you, I'm supposed to just <em>let you go</em>?"</p>
	<p>He stared at her, unblinking, for the better part of a minute before responding. "My name is Kient"</p>
	<p>"Kent, eh? Nice name," she replied, pen suddenly active.</p>
	<p>"No, it's 'Kee-ent'" he said, carefully stressing the difference.</p>
	<p>"Ok then. Where are you from?"</p>
	<p>"You don't want to know."</p>
	<p>"Humor me," Evelyn insisted.</p>
	<p>"You won't believe me."</p>
</div>
<div class="page">
	<p>"I've watched you perform impossible acts, know things you had no business knowing, not to mention appearing out of thin air! Try me," she challenged.</p>
	<p>"First of all, not thin air, it was a near-vacuum," Kient clarified. "I'm from about 300 years in your future."</p>
	<p>"How'd you wind up here?" Evelyn asked. "According to a scientist I interviewed a couple of years ago, time travel requires going faster than the speed of light, which is impossible."</p>
	<p>
		"The scientist was wrong," Kient stated flatly. "I don't know the details; I didn't invent this" he said, gesturing to his arm band, "If I had, I would have made comfort a <em>far</em> higher priority." He adjusted the arm band further, before letting his arm fall to his side. The band was far heavier than it looked, and Kient found every excuse to rest his left arm, be that via a countertop or the back of a chair. "If there were more than one of these things, maybe my orders wouldn't have included '<em>Never, under any circumstances, remove the time travel device from your arm,</em>' but that's not the reality we live in," he complained.
	</p>
	<p>
		"I'm so sorry," Evelyn replied sarcastically. "What's your purpose here?"
	</p>
	<p>
		"This is the first long-range test," he explained. "We've done some short range jumps before; hours, sometimes a couple of days, once an entire month. We've never gone back into real history until now."
	</p>
	<p>
		"Does it work forwards in time too," Evelyn asked, "or are you stuck here?"
	</p>
	<p>
		"I'm not trapped here," Kient insisted, "but if I went back to my own time, I don't think I'll be able to get back to now."
	</p>
	<p>"Why would that be? You got here the first time. What makes a return trip different?"</p>
	<p>"It'sâ€¦ complicated."</p>
	<p>Evelyn sighed. "Alright, I'll return to that question later," she said, much to Kient's relief.</p>
</div>
<div class="page">
	<p>"You're not going to write an article about me, are you?" Kient asked, suddenly nervous as he remembered her occupation.</p>
	<p>"As much as my boss would love an article as absurd as this, no; I'd rather preserve my credibility."</p>
	<p>
		"What else do you have?"
	</p>
