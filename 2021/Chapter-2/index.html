	<h1>Chapter 2</h1>
	<p class="subtitle">One Week Later</p>
	<p>"I never did catch your name," the young lady, black hair loose, curls falling just below her shoulders, remarked, gaze flicking between him and her notebook. She sat in a ragged chair, upholstery torn and stained. It was the only chair in the baren room.</p>
	<p>Standing carefully, watching the doorway, sleeve pulled up revealing a bulky black armband extending from elbow to wrist, Kient fiddled with it, trying to adjust it to a more comfortable position. "You didn't somehow fail to catch my name, I just didn't give it to you," he countered.</p>
	<p>"You <em>clearly</em> don't get how this works," the lady hazarded. "My name is Evelyn, fief Net," she intoned. "Now you try."</p>
	<p>"I don't have time for this!" he shouted, wincing as his armband pinched him.</p>
	<p>"Do you know how long I've searched for you!" Evelyn shot back. "I'm not letting you leave until you answer my questions. You've caused nothing but chaos in my life, then I find someone trying to murder you, and then a city block burns down in your vicinity. And now that I've cornered you, I'm supposed to just <em>let you go</em>?"</p>
	<p>He stared at her, unblinking, for the better part of a minute before responding. "My name is Kient"</p>
	<p>"Kent, eh? Nice name," she replied, pen suddenly active.</p>
	<p>"No, it's 'Kee-ent'" he said, carefully stressing the difference.</p>
	<p>"Ok then. Where are you from?"</p>
	<p>"You don't want to know."</p>
	<p>"Humor me," Evelyn insisted.</p>
	<p>"You won't believe me."</p>
</div>
<div class="page">
	<p>"I've watched you perform impossible acts, know things you had no business knowing, not to mention appearing out of thin air! Try me," she challenged.</p>
	<p>"First of all, not thin air, it was a near-vacuum," Kient clarified. "I'm from about 300 uniyears in your future."</p>
	<p>"How'd you wind up here?" Evelyn asked. "According to a scientist I interviewed a couple of uniyears ago, time travel requires going faster than the speed of light, which is impossible."</p>
	<p>
		"The scientist was wrong," Kient stated flatly. "I don't know the details; I didn't invent this," he said, gesturing to his armband, "If I had, I would have made comfort a <em>far</em> higher priority." He adjusted the armband further, before letting his arm fall to his side. The band was far heavier than it looked, and Kient found every excuse to rest his left arm, be that via a countertop or the back of a chair. "If there were more than one of these things, maybe my orders wouldn't have included '<em>Never, under any circumstances, remove the time travel device from your arm,</em>' but that's not the reality we live in," he complained.
	</p>
	<p>
		"I'm so sorry," Evelyn replied sarcastically. "What's your purpose here?"
	</p>
	<p>
		"This is the first long-range test," he explained. "We've done some short-range jumps before; hours, sometimes a couple of days, once an entire month. We've never gone back into real history until now."
	</p>
	<p>
		"Does it work forwards in time too," Evelyn asked, "or are you stuck here?"
	</p>
	<p>
		"I'm not trapped here," Kient insisted, "but if I went back to my own time, I don't think I'll be able to get back to now."
	</p>
	<p>"Why would that be? You got here the first time. What makes a return trip different?"</p>
	<p>"It's… complicated."</p>
	<p>Evelyn sighed. "Alright, I'll return to that question later," she said, much to Kient's relief.</p>
</div>
<div class="page">
	<p>"You're not going to write an article about me, are you?" Kient asked, suddenly nervous as he remembered her occupation.</p>
	<p>"As much as my boss would love an article as absurd as this, no; I'd rather preserve my credibility."</p>
	<p>
		"What else do you have?"
	</p>
	<p>"I think that tides me over for now. I trust there is a place I can find you when I come up with more questions?"</p>
	<p>"Yes. I've struck a deal with a local mechanic. I help him out in his shop, and he gives me food and lodging." He rattled off the address, her pen furiously taking note.</p>
	<p class="sectionbreak">***</p>
	<p>Evelyn's eyes ran over the man who had caused so much chaos in her life, his grimy overalls making sense now. She glanced out the door at the foreign street. "We should probably head back," she said, gesturing to the car.</p>
	<p>He nodded. They got in, Evelyn driving, and began the five-hour journey back to Evelyn's home city of Arack. "So what's it like in the future?" Evelyn interrupted after a few minutes of silence.</p>
	<p>"Things aren't great, at least not here on Ranaak" he replied.</p>
	<p>"Ranaak?" Evelyn asked, confused.</p>
	<p>"This planet," he explained. "After we ran into other inhabited planets, we had to find some way of differentiating between them. One country had taken over this planet at the time, a country called Ranaak, and so the planet got the designation as well."</p>
	<p>"So there are other inhabited planets out there?"</p>
	<p>"Correct. The ones we've found are Ruuli and Viivil. We're pretty sure they aren't the only other inhabited planets leftover though. Now, you people keep talking about 'fiefs.' What in the world do you mean? I've checked the dictionary and it says fiefs are parcels of land, owned by lords, usually with serfs or peasants living under them, but when I ask what land a particular fief consists of, I'm met with blank stares."</p>
</div>
<div class="page">
	<p>"I've never heard of that definition before; I wonder if the word got adapted later."</p>
	<p>"No, the dictionary I'm using is a copy of a relic we discovered from before the Rangaan war. It's certainly older than your country."</p>
	<p>"Huh," Evelyn grunted. "Fiefs here aren't about land. Instead, they are more… abstract branches of the economy. The Net fief mostly consists of journalists, book writers, and, nowadays at least, radio. In the original charter, Net was given dominion over information, be that news or media. Another example is the Hiij fief. The Hiij fief works on public services, establishments, etcetera."</p>
	<p>"So… is each fief like a business?" Kient asked.</p>
	<p>"I don't know what you mean."</p>
	<p>"A business is a group of people who collectively offer services or products for money. Like," he said, trying to come up with the right words. "Like," Kient repeated, "like, how much is each fief a part of the government, and how much of it is an autonomous organization?"</p>
	<p>"Depends on the fief," Evelyn answered, "but usually a fair bit of both. In each fief, there are five to twenty 'masters' and a couple hundred 'lords,' with the rest of us as Vassals. Everyone of 'lord' or higher has a vote in our government, weighted by dividing their vote by the number of their rank in the fief.</p>
	<p>"Not what I'm used to, but I suppose it makes sense. And how autonomous from the government are they?" he prompted.</p>
	<p>"Every Lord is in many ways independent to their fief. Each lord hires from inside their fief and sends a cut of whatever profits they make as fief taxes."</p>
	<p>"It sounds like every lord owns their own business," Kient commented.</p>
	<p>"I suppose."</p>
