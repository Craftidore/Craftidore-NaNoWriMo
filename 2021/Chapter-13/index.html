	<p>"You look frazzeled," Arthur commented over the clicking of his and Evelyn's typewriters.</p>
	<p>Evelyn looked up from her typewriter. "I'm just tired. It was a long night," she deflected, trying not to think about the traumatic event last night. The sound of gunfire kept sounding in her ears.</p>
	<p>"You've had long nights before. It's never been like this," he pressed on, undetered. Evelyn flinched when he spoke. <em>Gunshots</em>.</p>
	<p>"How far should I go for a story?" she asks instead. "At what point is it no longer worth it?"</p>
	<p>Arthur leaned back in the newly invented 'office chair' their paper had invested in. "Never let this job become more important than your life. Transfering fief may make you want to prove yourself, but if you aren't taking care of your emotional and physical needs, you won't be of any use to our fief."</p>
	<p>"And if it's not about the fief?"</p>
	<p>"Stories aren't supposed to be personal," Arthur warned.</p>
	<p>"It's not <em>personal</em>," she clarified, "it's just a mystery I want to solve that's taking more out of me than I thought it would."</p>
	<p class="sectionbreak">***</p>
	<p>Evelyn paced the floor of her apartment. She'd already tried reading a novel, her normal destress technique. Right now she was listening to three seperate radio broadcasts. Evelyn's father always laughed at this. "If you have three playing, you can't actually <em>listen</em> to any of them," he argued, confused. "That's the point!" she'd counter, "I don't care what they're actually saying, I just like trying to concentrate on multiple things at once." Every drumbeat or sharp sound Evelyn heard echoed of gunfire.</p>
