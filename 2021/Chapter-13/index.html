	<p>"You look frazzeled," Arthur commented over the clicking of his and Evelyn's typewriters.</p>
	<p>Evelyn looked up from her typewriter. "I'm just tired. It was a long night," she deflected, trying not to think about the traumatic event last night. The sound of gunfire kept sounding in her ears.</p>
	<p>"You've had long nights before. It's never been like this," he pressed on, undetered. Evelyn flinched when he spoke. <em>Gunshots</em>.</p>
	<p>"How far should I go for a story?" she asks instead. "At what point is it no longer worth it?"</p>
	<p>Arthur leaned back in the newly invented 'office chair' their paper had invested in. "Never let this job become more important than your life. Transfering fief may make you want to prove yourself, but if you aren't taking care of your emotional and physical needs, you won't be of any use to our fief."</p>
	<p>"And if it's not about the fief?"</p>
	<p>"Stories aren't supposed to be personal," Arthur warned.</p>
	<p>"It's not personal, it's just a mystery I want to solve."</p>
