	<h1>Chapter 9</h1>
	<p class="subtitle">Sunday, November 27<sup>th</sup>, UniYear 137 — Arc 3</p>
	<p>"You 'want in?'" Evelyn repeated. "What?"</p>
	<p>"Look," Samantha continued, her voice impatient and annoyed, stretched to its limit, "I've seen how you two are acting. It's either some sort of elaborate game or else you're secret operatives of some kind. Either way, it's a good deal more interesting than anything else in this city. Let me help. I want in." Her explanation finished, she shrugged.</p>
	<p>"I'm sorry," Kient said. "We're not operatives or anything."</p>
	<p>"If we were," Evelyn said, "aren't you afraid we'll kill you for knowing too much?"</p>
	<p>"Nah," Samantha dismissed confidently. "Whatever media claims, I don't think secret agents would kill without a really good reason. Murder is still murder, and you'd draw way too much suspicion on yourselves even if you managed to avoid getting pinned for the crime."</p>
	<p>
		"We're nothing like that," Evelyn said.
	</p>
	<p>"Then you won't mind letting me in," Samantha concluded.</p>
	<p>"And what if what we're doing is personal?" Evelyn countered.</p>
	<p>"Ooo, juicy!" Samantha said. "If so, I want in even more."</p>
	<p>"Well, you're still in for disappointment. I'm exactly what I said: a journalist writing an article on the emperor's inauguration speech.</p>
	<p>"Then what's Kient here for?" Samantha asked, pushing past him, and swaggering into his suite. She braked to a halt, staring at the whirring box on his bed. "What is <em>that</em>?"</p>
	<p>"Do I need to get hotel security?" Kient asked.</p>

<div class="page">
	<p>"No, no," Samantha assured him. "But… it's putting out light," she gestured, "light in the shape of words." Awed, she stepped back. "'Printing'" she read. "Printing what?"</p>
	<p>"Yes, Kient," Evelyn added. "<em>tell us what you're printing.</em> You know I hate surprises."</p>
	<p>Staring at her, eyes incredulous, Kient said "You <em>love</em> surprises."</p>
	<p>"Well… I hate <em>waiting</em> for surprises," she said.</p>
