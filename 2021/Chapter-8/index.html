	<p>"So why don't we, normal people that is, see things disappearing like that whenever we get off track?" Evelyn asked, temporarily distracted. "Why does it have to be time travelers that can mess up the past—err, present—you know what I mean. Why haven't I seen this happen before?"</p>
	<p>"I'm not sure," Kient answered. "However, when we tried time traveling into a situation without knowing what happened in that situation, we weren't able mess up the past any. Only with foreknowledge can we screw things up."</p>
	<p>"So now you've cost me a car," Evelyn concluded, face souring. "I'm going," she announced, "I've got a contact who might be able to help find them. He opens up shop in the morning." Kient stared at her as she marched off, forced to walk back to the house.</p>
	<p><em>I really ought to avoid getting to close to people</em> he thought to himself. No, normal non-time-traveling people couldn't change history, but that was because they didn't know what the future held. Normal non-time-traveling people who'd talked with time travelers were another story, and the car disappearing might only be indirectly his fault, if one of her actions had changed history, rather than his. <em>It's testable</em> he comforted himself. For some strange reason, objects disapeared in close proximity to the one who changed history. If things kept disappearing around him, it was his fault, and he'd have to find some way to fix it. There was nothing for him to do but head home and see what happened tomorrow.</p>

	<p>"It's just gone!" declared the flustered mechanic. "Somehow a theif snuck into my garage, opened the loud car-sized garage door, drove off in one of the red car, all without waking me or the other tenants."</p>
	<p><em>I guess it's my fault</em> Kient concluded. This revelation, while not surprising, was rather annoying. He'd spent a lot of mental energy on <em>not</em> interfering with anything local if it was within his control.</p>
