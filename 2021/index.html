<h1>Right Place, Right Time</h1>
<h2 class="subtitle">A Story of Time Travel</h2>
<p>I'm hosting my NaNoWriMo story here for now. <a href="#tableofcontents">Jump to table of contents.</a></p>
<p>NaNoWriMo, short for National Novel Writing Month, is a non-profit organization that encourages aspiring writers to write a 50,000 word first draft of a novel in a month (to be specific, the month of November), providing structure, community, and support for those writers.</p>
<p>Participants in NaNoWriMo are encouraged to "write fast, not good." As I am normally prone to focusing exclusively on a single paragraph, fiddling with it for an hour trying to get it just right, I'm focusing primarily on trying to complete the novel, resisting the urge to edit wherever I can. This doesn't mean I don't want your feedback, it just means I'm going to write it down, set it aside, and only make changes after November ends. Another side effect of this strategy, as I'm sure you'll notice when you read it, is that the novel isn't exactly the highest possible standard of English writing; the dialogue is choppy, spelling is a second priority, and some parts are probably going to be a bit boring. If this drives you away, and you only want to read the final (and thankfully edited) version, I completely understand. For everyone who's still here, thank you. Every person who's willing to read this as I write it gives me that little bit of extra motivation to keep writing, and hopefully write the full 50,000 words by midnight, November 30th.</p>
<p>I mark a chapter complete by adding a word count next to the chapter listing. This means that I'm not planning to add any new scenes to it. Sometimes I'll go back and change particularly egregious problems, such as the 'spicy rice and algae taco' I originally mentioned in Chapter 1, which Kathryn pointed out the absurdity of, but aside from such situations, these chapters aren't going to change any in the future. If you're only looking to read a chapter after I've fully finished writing it, that's what you want to look for.</p>
