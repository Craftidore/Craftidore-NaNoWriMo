	<h1>Chapter 4</h1>
	<p class="subtitle">Sunday, November 6<sup>th</sup>, UniYear 137 â€” Arc 1</p>
	<p>Evelyn's apartment, sparse and utilitarian, stared her down, issuing it's challenge without a word. Boxes, strewn around the main room, hastily labeled and still unpacked, taunted her. The weekend had been hectic as she balanced writing with the strain of moving to her new apartment. The raise she received three weeks ago, her first raise since she'd changed fiefs three uniyears ago, meant she could finally afford an apartment that wasn't falling apart or infested with roaches. Evelyn had jumped at the opportunity.</p>
	<p>She tackled the kitchen first, paraphernalia first, followed by dishes, and finally the radio.</p>
	<p style="text-align: center;text-indent: 0px;">
		<em>Knock Knock Knock</em>
	</p>
	<p>Pausing her work, Evelyn answered the door, revealing her father, reddish-brown beard glistening in the morning sun. "Father," she greeted him.</p>
	<p>"You didn't tell me you were moving," he accused.</p>
	<p>"I didn't expect you to care."</p>
	<p>"I'll always care."</p>
	<p>"How'd you find out my new address?" she asked, confused.</p>
	<p>"Arthur mentioned it," her father clarified. "I figured I should come over and help you unpack. I'm not needed at the lab today, just your mother Renette."</p>
	<p>"In other words, you were able to slip away without her noticing," Evelyn read between the lines.</p>
	<p>"Just because Renette may have written you off as a traitor to the fief doesn't change that you're my daughter and I love you," he emphatically replied.</p>

	<p>Evelyn pointed him in the direction of the unpacked boxes. "If it's practical, stash it in a drawer or closet and I'll find it later," Evelyn instructed. "Anything artsy leave out and I'll display it later."</p>
	<p>They worked for the better part of a half an hour primarily in silence, before Evelyn's father spoke up. "When are you going to interview the creators of the new vacuum machine?" he asked.</p>
	<p>"Well, if I make enough progress on the apartment, today sounds like a good idea.</p>
	<p>"Why don't you start now?"</p>
	<p>"What do you mean?"</p>
	<p>"Well, it's as much my creation as anyone else on the team."</p>
	<p>"Oh," she replied, stepping out of the room. Returning, she sat down in a chair with flowered upholstery, the pattern matching the her notebook.</p>
	<p>"When did you begin working on this project?" Evelyn began. "How long has this project existed and when will it be completed?"</p>
	<p>"Half a year, half a year, and it's really already completed," Mr. Mechan answered.</p>
	<p>"What are you working on now?"</p>
	<p>"We're testing how various chemicals react in a vacuum. There are some medicines that use a vacuum in their production, and with the advances we made in creating this vacuum chamber, we're looking into methods of mass producing these chambers.</p>
	<p>
		Evelyn bounded out of her seat. "I think that's all I'll need from you, father," she informed. "I can't wait to see it in action!"
	</p>
	<p>Her father gestured to the boxes they'd emptied. "I think we've put in enough work for today. Tell you what, meet me at your mom and my lab at 8 O'Clock tonight and I'll show you it in action.</p>
