	<h1>Chapter 4</h1>
	<p class="subtitle">Sunday, November 6<sup>th</sup>, UniYear 137 â€” Arc 1</p>
	<p>Evelyn's apartment, sparse and utilitarian, stared her down, issuing it's challenge without a word. Boxes, strewn around the main room, hastily labeled and still unpacked, taunted her. The weekend had been hectic as she balanced writing with the strain of moving to her new apartment. The raise she received three weeks ago, her first raise since she'd changed fiefs three uniyears ago, meant she could finally afford an apartment that wasn't falling apart or infested with roaches. Evelyn had jumped at the opportunity.</p>
	<p>She tackled the kitchen first, with her paraphernalia taking priority, followed by dishes, and finally the radio.</p>
	<p style="text-align: center;text-indent: 0px;">
		<em>Knock Knock Knock</em>
	</p>
	<p>Pausing her work, Evelyn answered the door, revealing her father, reddish-brown beard glistening in the morning sun. "Father," she greeted him.</p>
	<p>"You didn't tell me you were moving," he accused.</p>
	<p>"I didn't expect you to care."</p>
	<p>"I'll always care."</p>
	<p>"How'd you find out my new address?" she asked, confused.</p>
	<p>"Arthur mentioned it," her father clarified. "I figured I should come over and help you unpack. I'm not needed at the lab today, just your mother Renette."</p>
	<p>"In other words, you were able to slip away without her noticing," Evelyn read between the lines.</p>
	<p>"Just because Renette may have written you off as a traitor to the fief doesn't change that you're my daughter and I love you," he emphatically replied.</p>
</div>
<div class="page">
	<p>Evelyn pointed him in the direction of the unpacked boxes. "If it's practical, stash it in a drawer or closet and I'll find it later," Evelyn instructed. "Anything artsy leave out and I'll display it later."</p>
	<p>They worked for the better part of a half an hour primarily in silence, before Evelyn's father spoke up. "When are you going to interview the creators of the new vacuum machine?" he asked.</p>
	<p>"Well, if I make enough progress on the apartment, today sounds like a good idea.</p>
	<p>"Why don't you start now?"</p>
	<p>"What do you mean?"</p>
	<p>"Well, it's as much my creation as anyone else on the team."</p>
	<p>"Oh," she replied, stepping out of the room. Returning, she sat down in a chair with flowered upholstery, the pattern matching the her notebook.</p>
	<p>"When did you begin working on this project?" Evelyn began. "How long has this project existed and when will it be completed?"</p>
	<p>"Half a year, half a year, and it's really already completed," Mr. Mechan answered.</p>
	<p>"What are you working on now?"</p>
	<p>"We're testing how various chemicals react in a vacuum. There are some medicines that use a vacuum in their production, and with the advances we made in creating this vacuum chamber, we're looking into methods of mass producing these chambers.</p>
	<p>
		Evelyn bounded out of her seat. "I think that's all I'll need from you, father," she informed. "I can't wait to see it in action!"
	</p>
	<p>Her father gestured to the boxes they'd emptied. "I think we've put in enough work for today. Tell you what, meet me at your mom's and my lab at 8 O'Clock tonight and I'll show you it in action.</p>

		Evelyn braked to a stop in front of a nondescript brick building. She blinked a few tears out of her eyes as she reflected on the last time she'd been here. Hopping off her  bike, she stepped up to the door, running her hand down it. The wood grain of the door, so familiar, greeted her like an old friend. She knocked.
	</p>
	<p>
		Latches slid back with a click, and the door fell away from her hand. "Long time no see," her father greeted her sarcastically.  
	</p>
	<p>
		"It's been less than a day," she countered, stepping in. Her father closed the door, locked and bolted the door. <em>Locks keep the bad guys out of the lab, and the lab out of the bad guys,</em> her mother told her when she'd first asked. The white stone walls of the lab, designed to keep in any stray explosions (not a likely hazard, but always a possible one) from hurting anyone outside the lab, greeted her.
	</p>
	<p>
		"The vacuum chamber is in the main room," he commented. As she followed him there, she could almost see the herself playing with toys, back when she was an only child. Her parents didn't want to pay for a babysitter so they would take her to work with them. Shaking away the memories, she examined the monstrous mechanism. The vacuum chamber's circular glass walls called to her, pleading for written description.  
	</p>
	<p>
		<em>Standing at head height, a circular glass tube, easily a meter in diameter, looms over the rest of the lab,</em> she wrote as her father worked with valves on the other side of the lab. <em>Sporting tubes, the vacuum chamber has no visible controls or levers on it, instead it is controlled by an operator at the other end of the tubes.</em>
	</p>
	<p>"Do you mind running it with some chemicals you're testing inside?"</p>
	<p>"Let's wait till we're running an actual experiment. Those are expensive, and I'll get in trouble for using them." Evelyn nodded, feeling foolish for not thinking about that. "Tell you what, I'll run to the store and grab a milk jug. I can explode it for you," he compromised, leaving the vacuum, unlocking, unlatching, and un-deadbolting the door, disappearing.</p>
	<p>Sitting down, Evelyn glanced around the lab, spying the bunsun burner she had such an obsession about as an eight-year-old. She squeezed her her eyes shut, reviewing her notes. A flash of movement catching her eye, she glanced up to find a man with blond hair in a buzz cut. His green eyes stared back at her through a full blown face mask, complete with it's own oxygen tank. She jerked, dropped her notebook, nearly falling out the chair.</p>
</div>
<div class="page">
	<p>Medium in height, still shorter than Evelyn's 6'2", he fit inside the vacuum chamber with room to spare, or would have if he wasn't wearing a massive camping backpack, leaving him very little room to maneuver. Evelyn searched the room for a large blunt object, finding a coat rack. She picked it up like a sword, ran back to the vacuum chamber, swinging with full force, and blowing a crack in the glass.</p>
	<p>Swinging again for the same spot, the air rushing in through the crack, Evelyn finally shattered the glass. The man, whom she'd now privately dubbed Mr. Vacuum, muttered a thank you, stepping out of the chamber. "Who are you?" Evelyn asked. He stretched quickly, ignoring her, pulled his right sleeve up, adjusting the bulky black arm band he wore there. He looked around the lab for the door, walking out. Evelyn stood dumbstruck, not entirely sure she hadn't imagined it. Surveying the broken glass, the only evidence of what she'd seen. <em>But it's not really evidence,</em> she realized. <em>I broke this glass, so it doesn't prove <em>anything.</em></em></p>
