	<h1>Chapter 3</h1>
	<p class="subtitle">Saturday, About Two Weeks Later, November 26<sup>th</sup>, UniYear 137 — Arc 3</p>
	<p>Evelyn and Kient were on a road trip once more. Evelyn insisted on keeping the windows down as they drove across the countryside. "I don't know how you can stand all this wind," Kient complained.</p>
	<p>"Oh please. Live a little!"</p>
	<p>"I am living a little," he shot back. "I went back in time to the second century for goodness' sake. I've already had far more 'living' than most people twice my age."</p>
	<p>"So?" Evelyn rolled her eyes.</p>
	<p>"So I think I'm entitled to avoid whatever needless excitement we encounter."</p>
	<p>"Did you just say 'needless excitement,'" Evelyn asked, "because I don't think that's a thing."</p>
	<p>"Just…" Kient tried to counter. "Nevermind." He sighed. "Leave the windows open." Evelyn pumped her fist in victory. </p>
	<p>Shortly thereafter, they arrived at their destination, the capitol of Cabu, a country neighboring Evelyn's own. "Did you bring your notebook like I asked?"</p>
	<p>Evelyn reached into her bag, pulling it out. "Yup. Why?"</p>
	<p>"It's a surprise," Kient insisted.</p>
	<p>"Uh huh. Must be quite the historical event," Evelyn commented.</p>
	<p>"Well," he said, "you won't be dissappointed."</p>
	<p class="sectionbreak">***</p>
	<p>Kient parked the car on the side of the road next to a small family-owned restaurant.</p>
</div>
<div class="page">
	<p>"Will you tell me <em>now</em>?"</p>
	<p>"And spoil the surprise?"</p>
	<p>"At least tell me it's not a violent revolution."</p>
	<p>"No, the revolution doesn't get started for another year," Kient remarked.</p>
	<p>"What‽"</p>
	<p>Keint held up his hands in surrender. "Forget I said anything."</p>
	<p>"Too late," she insisted. "Anything I should know in order to stay out of trouble?"</p>
	<p>"You? Stay out of trouble?" Kient asked as he got out of the car, quickly circling it and getting Evelyn's door for her.</p>
	<p>"<em>Fine.</em> Is there anything I should know so I can keep from getting in <em>too much</em> trouble?" Evelyn revised, climbing out of the car.</p>
	<p>Kient listed a couple of countries not to vacation in. "The revolution itself dies out in three years, but it has some impressive societal implications," he said. "And <em>no</em>, I'm not going to tell you what those implications are," he quickly added.</p>
	<p>"You're no fun," Evelyn accused, mock annoyed, as Kient held the door open to the restaurant.</p>
	<p>"Table for two?" the portly waiter asked upon their entrance.</p>
	<p>"Yes," Kient answered, "a table by the window please."</p>
	<p>"How about this:" Evelyn attempted, "Don't tell me what's going to happen, just some things I should, y'know, keep an eye out for." Kient ignored her.</p>
	<p>"Wait…" Evelyn said, sidetracked. "Money's different in the future, so does that mean I'm paying?"</p>
	<p>"Before I started the mission, we purchased some coins from your time," he said. "There isn't a good way of tracking what I actually use them for, so I figured this would be a nice use for them."</p>
</div>
<div class="page">
	<p>"Ok, good," Evelyn responded. The waiter returned, taking their drink and appetizer orders. "So, you didn't say what I should look out for."</p>
	<p>"We're going to see the emperor's inauguration speech."</p>
	<p>"Oh," Evelyn said, disappointed. The rest of the dinner was pleasant, but uneventful. Evelyn gave up, ceasing her attempts to pry information from Keint.</p>
