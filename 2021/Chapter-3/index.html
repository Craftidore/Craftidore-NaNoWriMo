	<h1>Chapter 3</h1>
	<p class="subtitle">Saturday, About Two Weeks Later, November 26<sup>th</sup>, UniYear 137 — Arc 3</p>
	<p>Evelyn and Kient were on a road trip once more. Evelyn insisted on keeping the windows down as they drove across the countryside. "I don't know how you can stand all this wind," Kient complained.</p>
	<p>"Oh please. Live a little!"</p>
	<p>"I am living a little," he shot back. "I went back in time to the second century for goodness' sake. I've already had far more 'living' than most people twice my age."</p>
	<p>"So?" Evelyn rolled her eyes.</p>
	<p>"So I think I'm entitled to avoid whatever needless excitement we encounter."</p>
	<p>"Did you just say 'needless excitement,'" Evelyn asked, "because I don't think that's a thing."</p>
	<p>"Just…" Kient tried to counter. "Nevermind." He sighed. "Leave the windows open." Evelyn pumped her fist in victory. </p>
	<p>Shortly thereafter, they arrived at their destination, the capital of Cabu, a country neighboring Evelyn's own. "Did you bring your notebook like I asked?"</p>
	<p>Evelyn reached into her bag, pulling it out. "Yup. Why?"</p>
	<p>"It's a surprise," Kient insisted.</p>
	<p>"Uh-huh. Must be quite the historical event," Evelyn commented.</p>
	<p>"Well," he said, "you won't be disappointed."</p>
	<p class="sectionbreak">***</p>
	<p>Kient parked the car on the side of the road next to a small family-owned restaurant.</p>
</div>
<div class="page">
	<p>"Will you tell me <em>now</em>?"</p>
	<p>"And spoil the surprise?"</p>
	<p>"At least tell me it's not a violent revolution."</p>
	<p>"No, the revolution doesn't get started for another year," Kient remarked.</p>
	<p>"What‽"</p>
	<p>Keint held up his hands in surrender. "Forget I said anything."</p>
	<p>"Too late," she insisted. "Anything I should know to stay out of trouble?"</p>
	<p>"You? Stay out of trouble?" Kient asked as he got out of the car, quickly circling it and getting Evelyn's door for her.</p>
	<p>"<em>Fine.</em> Is there anything I should know so I can keep from getting in <em>too much</em> trouble?" Evelyn revised, climbing out of the car.</p>
	<p>Kient listed a couple of countries not to vacation in. "The revolution itself dies out in three years, but it has some impressive societal implications," he said. "And <em>no</em>, I'm not going to tell you what those implications are," he quickly added.</p>
	<p>"You're no fun," Evelyn accused, mock annoyed, as Kient held the door open to the restaurant.</p>
	<p>"Table for two?" the portly waiter asked upon their entrance.</p>
	<p>"Yes," Kient answered, "a table by the window please."</p>
	<p>"How about this:" Evelyn attempted, "Don't tell me what's going to happen, just some things I should, y'know, keep an eye out for." Kient ignored her.</p>
	<p>"Wait…" Evelyn said, sidetracked. "Money's different in the future, so does that mean I'm paying?"</p>
	<p>"Before I started the mission, we purchased some coins and preserved bills from your time," he said. "There isn't a good way of tracking what I actually use them for, so I figured this would be a nice use for them."</p>
</div>
<div class="page">
	<p>"Ok, good," Evelyn responded. The waiter returned, taking their drink and appetizer orders. "So, you didn't say what I should look out for."</p>
	<p>"We're going to see the emperor's inauguration speech."</p>
	<p>"Oh," Evelyn said, disappointed. The rest of the dinner was pleasant but uneventful. Evelyn gave up, ceasing her attempts to pry information from Keint.</p>
	<p class="sectionbreak">***</p>
	<p>Kient smiled; the restaurant gambit had worked, and Evelyn's mind wasn't on the history about to unfold. From the restaurant, they walked the short mile to the city square wherein the emperor would give his speech. While Evelyn was distracted, he pulled a newspaper out of his satchel, checking to make sure the date and time were correct.</p>
	<p>The square of the city, huge and wide-open, leaving many disoriented by its sheer vastness, bustled with activity. The crowd was beginning to trickle in, the square slowly edging toward cramped, though the speech wouldn't start for another half hour.</p>
	<p>"We'll need a spot near the edges of the crowd," Kient informed Evelyn. "It'll be safer." They crawled against the flow of the crowd, fighting like a ship tacking against the wind. The speech nearing, Cabu flags unfurled from the capital building, which loomed above the rest of the square. Glancing around, Kient noticed some primitive speakers attached to various buildings around the square.</p>
	<p>Ten minutes before the speech was supposed to start, the new emperor stepped out onto the balcony. "Ahem," he coughed. "I know it's early, but I got bored up here, so we're starting early," he informed the crowd, voice echoing through the square. "Today is the day I am crowned!" he announced joyously.</p>
	<p>"Impatient…" Evelyn muttered, scribbling in her notebook.</p>
	<p>Rushing the ceremony, and eschewing the normal customs, the new emperor reached over to the crown, picked it up, and placed it squarely on his head. The crowd gasped, the noise growing in strength as it was emanated from so many people at once.</p>
</div>
<div class="page">
	<p>"What?" the emperor asked, genuinely puzzled. "It was my crown, as it was my father's before me. Which matters more? The ceremony or the man who wears the crown? I swear to you that the man who wears the crown will be more valuable than any amount of ceremony!"</p>
	<p>Kient looked at Evelyn questioningly. "It's the most interesting inauguration speech I've seen yet," she admitted.</p>
	<p>"Just wait," he ordered.</p>
	<p>"By wearing this crown, I become Cabu and Cabu becomes me. Its power is my power. Its people—you—are <em>my</em> people, and their—<strong>your</strong>—wellbeing is my wellbeing." He paused for dramatic effect, crowd muttering, not entirely certain if his words bode well or poorly for them. "I have an announcement! As my first act as Emperor of Cabu, we are gearing up for war!" he shouted so loud, one could almost hear him without the speakers. The crowd fell into a dumbstruck silence.</p>
	<p>"Uh oh." Evelyn looked around to see who had spoken before realizing it had come from her.</p>
	<p>"Our first target shall be Geria!" the Emperor concluded. Kient checked his watch.</p>
	<p>"Any second now," he insisted. The emperor bowed and stepped back into the skyscraper from which he had come. "What?" Keint insisted. "That can't be!"</p>
	<p>"Four weeks ago we have excellent relationships with Cabu, and now they're attacking us at the drop of a hat‽" Evelyn asked rhetorical, not entirely believing what she had heard. She turned to Kient. "You made it sound like this was something to get excited about!" she accused. He reached into his satchel, pulling out a beat-up old newspaper, dated for a week from now. He handed it to her, pointing to an article. Titled <em>The Fall of Emperor Arthur IV of Cabu</em>, it summarily spoke of the emperor who had just been crowned, telling of his speech proclaiming war against Geria, then informing the reader he had been assassinated the day of his inauguration, during the closing of his speech.</p>
	<p>"But this didn't happen," Evelyn spoke.</p>
</div>
<div class="page">
	<p>"All the history books say it did," he told her. Then he pointed to the author of the article: Evelyn Mechan.</p>
