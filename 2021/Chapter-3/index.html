	<p>Evelyn and Kient were on a road trip once more. Evelyn insisted on keeping the windows down as they drove across the countryside. "I don't know how you can stand all this wind," Kient complained.</p>
	<p>"Oh please. Live a little!"</p>
	<p>"I am living a little," he shot back. "I went back in time to the second century for goodness' sake. I've already had far more 'living' than most people twice my age."</p>
	<p>"So?" Evelyn rolled her eyes.</p>
	<p>"So I think I'm entitled to avoid whatever needless excitement we encounter."</p>
	<p>"Did you just say 'needless excitement,'" Evelyn asked, "because I don't think that's a thing."</p>
	<p>"Just…" Kient tried to counter. "Nevermind." He sighed. "Leave the windows open." Evelyn pumped her fist in victory. "Did you bring your notebook like I asked?"</p>
	<p>Evelyn reached into her bag, pulling it out. "Yup. Why?"</p>
	<p>"It's a surprise," Kient insisted.</p>
	<p>"Uh huh. Must be quite the historical event," Evelyn commented.</p>
	<p>"Well," he said, "you won't be dissappointed."</p>
