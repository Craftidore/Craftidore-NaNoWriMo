	<h1>Chapter 10</h1>
	<p class="subtitle">Monday, November 7<sup>th</sup>, UniYear 137 — Arc 1</p>
	<p class="sound">Screeeeeech.</p>
	<p>Dismounting from her bike, Evelyn unslung her purse, pulling out the bike chain. Fastening her bike to the rack, she spotted her neighbor coming down the stairs.</p>
	<p>"You have a visitor," her neighbor said. "Whoever it was had a key and let themselves in.</p>
	<p>"But I haven't given anyone a key," Evelyn thought out loud, thoughts of her bike taking second place. She rushed up the stairs, fumbled for her own keys, and unlocked the door.</p>
	<p>Kirk sat in the middle of the living room, head buried in a book from Evelyn's shelf. "You have good taste," he commented.</p>
	<p>"Normally, you give me a letter telling me when and where to meet you," Evelyn said. "Today, I find you in my apartment—my <em>locked</em> apartment, which, according to my neighbor, you had a key for—with no warning. <em>Why</em>? Also, <em>how</em>?" Evelyn asked, dumbstruck and reeling, as her brain reengaged.</p>
	<p>"You're the first person this year to give me a true challenge. Nothing—NOTHING!—is known about this man. He has no history, no point when he entered or left the city, no impact. If I hadn't seen him with my own eyes, I would have sworn he didn't exist."</p>
	<p>"Does this mean I don't owe you anything?" Evelyn asked, both hopeful and fearful of the answer.</p>
	<p>
		"Not even Mr. Mystery here could truly escape me," Kirk told her, his tone informative, not prideful. "He hasn't given his name out, to <em>anyone</em>, as far as I can tell. He seems to be shopping for a place to hole up. He's settled under a bridge, using some sort of tent." He gave her the bridge address. 
	</p>
	<p>"That still seems sparse," Evelyn commented.</p>

<div class="page">
	<p>"You asked for the impossible, and I delivered," Kirk stated flatly. "I do have a bit more," he told her, handing her a set of papers. "Little observations, places where he's been spotted, etc."</p>
	<p>"I suppose that'll have to do," Evelyn said.</p>
	<p>"Tell you what," Kirk continued. "You found a request near impossible even for me. It was the most fun I've had in ages. I'll give you a five percent discount for that; that's five percent off my rate for basic information, given that's all I could come up with."</p>
	<p>Evelyn knew negotiating with Kirk would be a waste of both their times, and if she refused to pay, he'd never sell her his services again, so she wrote him his check, handing it over regretfully.</p>
	<p>"So nice to do business with you deary," he said as he left.</p>
