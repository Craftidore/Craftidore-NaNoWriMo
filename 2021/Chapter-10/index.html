	<h1>Chapter 10</h1>
	<p class="subtitle">Monday/Tuesday, November 7<sup>th</sup>/8<sup>th</sup>, UniYear 137 — Arc 1</p>
	<p class="sound">Screeeeeech.</p>
	<p>Dismounting from her bike, Evelyn unslung her purse, pulling out the bike chain. Fastening her bike to the rack, she spotted her neighbor coming down the stairs.</p>
	<p>"You have a visitor," her neighbor said. "Whoever it was had a key and let themselves in.</p>
	<p>"But I haven't given anyone a key," Evelyn thought out loud, thoughts of her bike taking second place. She rushed up the stairs, fumbled for her own keys, and unlocked the door.</p>
	<p>Kirk sat in the middle of the living room, head buried in a book from Evelyn's shelf. "You have good taste," he commented.</p>
	<p>"Normally, you give me a letter telling me when and where to meet you," Evelyn said. "Today, I find you in my apartment—my <em>locked</em> apartment, which, according to my neighbor, you had a key for—with no warning. <em>Why</em>? Also, <em>how</em>?" Evelyn asked, dumbstruck and reeling, as her brain reengaged.</p>
	<p>"You're the first person this year to give me a true challenge. Nothing—NOTHING!—is known about this man. He has no history, no point when he entered or left the city, no impact. If I hadn't seen him with my own eyes, I would have sworn he didn't exist."</p>
	<p>"Does this mean I don't owe you anything?" Evelyn asked, both hopeful and fearful of the answer.</p>
	<p>
		"Not even Mr. Mystery here could truly escape me," Kirk told her, his tone informative, not prideful. "He hasn't given his name out, to <em>anyone</em>, as far as I can tell. He seems to be shopping for a place to hole up. He's settled under a bridge, using some sort of tent." He gave her the bridge address. 
	</p>
	<p>"That still seems sparse," Evelyn commented.</p>
</div>
<div class="page">
	<p>"You asked for the impossible, and I delivered," Kirk stated flatly. "I do have a bit more," he told her, handing her a set of papers. "Little observations, places where he's been spotted, etc."</p>
	<p>"I suppose that'll have to do," Evelyn said.</p>
	<p>"Tell you what," Kirk continued. "You found a request near impossible even for me. It was the most fun I've had in ages. I'll give you a five percent discount for that; that's five percent off my rate for basic information, given that's all I could come up with."</p>
	<p>Evelyn knew negotiating with Kirk would be a waste of both their times, and if she refused to pay, he'd never sell her his services again, so she wrote him his check, handing it over regretfully.</p>
	<p>"So nice to do business with you deary," he said as he left.</p>
	<p class="sectionbreak">***</p>
	<p>Evelyn glanced at the address. She'd written it in her notebook, just in case she lost Kirk's papers. She began to regret her decision, as her mind drifted from her interview to the mystery before her.</p>
	<p>"Are you even listening to what I have to say?" her interviewee asked, noticing that she'd stopped taking notes.</p>
	<p>"I'm sorry, it's been a long day, and my brain is on the fritz," she said.</p>
	<p>He replied, "So, really, there's no point to this interview."</p>
	<p>"No, not that. What you have to say is interesting and important. I'll try to stay awake harder," she said.</p>
	<p>Sighing, he said "Fine," and continued his explanation of the economic trends caused by the changes in paper supplies.</p>
	<p>She managed to <em>mostly</em> stay awake through the rest of the interview, but she rushed through formalities when they had concluded, eager to get out the door. Half-stumbling as she mounted her bike, she decided to take a nap before investigating the bridge. Hopefully he wouldn't move before then.</p>

	<p>Groggily raising her head from the pillow, Evelyn checked the clock. It read two hundred. <em>I must have been more tired than I realized</em> Evelyn reflected. She debated going back to sleep, then decided on a compromise of a midnight snack. Sneaking out to the kitchen, staring at the refridgerator for a period of time her mother would be annoyed by, she grabbed the supplies for a light sandwich. After piecing it together, upon slight reflection, she also pulled out the mustard, applying it liberally.</p>
	<p>As she sat down on a chair which had, against all expectation, remained clear of unpacked but unorganized clutter, her eyes drifted to the papers Kirk had left her. <em>They aren't going to read themselves</em> she reasoned. <em>I can't read them during the day; work's been too hectic, with one interview after another, unending.</em> She reached out for the papers with slightly mustardy hands, not caring whether she dirtied them.</p>
	<p>She skimmed them first, determining the lay of the land. The first four pages were filled with sightings; location, time, source, and any available contextual information. Skipping past it, she found Kirk's conclusions.</p>
	<p>"I genuinely don't know how this man got into the city," Kirk's papers said. "No one has seen him before two days ago, and I've got a running list of everyone who entered this city in the past three years; he's not on it. In light of this revelation, and factoring in the actions he has made, I decided that when he arrived was the wrong question, and instead treat him as spontaneously bursting into existence yesterday.</p>
	<p>"This isn't the first time I've had to do this. About three months ago, I was set on a similar case, and found a man for whom no knowledge was to be had prior to a certain date. In that case, I was hired by the subject in question, as he was hoping to acquire a measure of how well he was able to cover his tracks."</p>
	<p><em>Delightful</em> Evelyn thought to herself. Kirk didn't usually include details about his prior business in his reports. On the one hand, what he had to say was fascinating, but on the other, Evelyn was impatient to know more about Mr. Vacuum.</p>
	<p>"I think the subject, based on the reports I've received on his conversations, is unfamiliar with Gerian culture. He stumbles when asked what fief he is from, and doesn't understand a number of idioms, but hasn't claimed to be from another country. Surprisingly, he doesn't have an accent.</p>
</div>
<div class="page">
	<p>"The real curiosity comes from the subject's thirst for knowledge. He's conducted at least 5 study sessions inside various libraries in and near the city. I managed to sneak an agent in for two of his study sessions. He appeared to be researching recent technological advances, usually based on country. He seemed to be primarily focused on vacuum chambers, regularly cross referencing books that talked about them.</p>
	<p>"Finally, he was always wearing a bulky black arm band. I have no clue why, but he seems unwilling to remove it, although he clearly finds it uncomfortable to wear."</p>
	<p>By the final paragraph, she was starting to nod off. By the end of it, Evelyn had fallen asleep, the final bite of sandwich still resting in her hand.</p>
	<p class="sectionbreak">***</p>
	<p>Evelyn strode up to the bridge. She'd endured another day of work, followed by two more interviews, and she wasn't going to put this off any longer, no matter how tired she was. The bridge loomed before her, it's frame miraculously supporting the fleet of cars traveling across it. Below it, the river Kij rushed, rocky rapids unsurpassable. Surveying, she remembered that Kirk only mentioned Mr. Vacuum spent the night here, but that he spent his days doing research. Cursing her forgetfulness, she trudged back to her bike, and rode back home. This time grabbing a lawn chair and a novel, she strapped the former onto her bike, zipping the latter into a pouch on the front of her bike.</p>
	<p>This time, Evelyn was prepared. She located a nice shady spot not quite under the bridge, but still on the concrete foundation beneath it. Setting up her chair, she got to reading, completing five chapters.</p>
