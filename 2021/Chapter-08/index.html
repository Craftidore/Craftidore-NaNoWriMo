	<h1>Chapter 8</h1>
	<p class="subtitle">Early Saturday/Saturday, November 11<sup>th</sup>, UniYear 137 — Arc 2</p>
	<p>"So why don't we, normal people that is, see things disappearing like that whenever we get off track?" Evelyn asked, temporarily distracted. "Why does it have to be time travelers that can mess up the past—err, present—you know what I mean. Why haven't I seen this happen before?"</p>
	<p>"I'm not sure," Kient answered. "However, when we tried time traveling into a situation without knowing what happened in that situation, we weren't able mess up the past any. Only with foreknowledge can we screw things up."</p>
	<p>"So now you've cost me a car," Evelyn concluded, face souring. "I'm going," she announced, "I've got a contact who might be able to help find them. He opens up shop in the morning." Kient stared at her as she marched off, forced to walk back to the house.</p>
	<p><em>I really ought to avoid getting to close to people</em> he thought to himself. No, normal non-time-traveling people couldn't change history, but that was because they didn't know what the future held. Normal non-time-traveling people who'd talked with time travelers were another story, and the car disappearing might only be indirectly his fault, if one of her actions had changed history, rather than his. <em>It's testable</em> he comforted himself. For some strange reason, objects disapeared in close proximity to the one who changed history. If things kept disappearing around him, it was his fault, and he'd have to find some way to fix it. There was nothing for him to do but head home and see what happened tomorrow.</p>
	<p class="sectionbreak">***</p>
	<p>"It's just gone!" declared the flustered mechanic. "Somehow a theif snuck into my garage, opened the loud car-sized garage door, drove off in one of the red car, all without waking me or the other tenants."</p>
	<p><em>I guess it's my fault</em> Kient concluded. This revelation, while not surprising, was rather annoying. He'd spent a lot of mental energy on <em>not</em> interfering with anything local, provided it was within his control.</p>
</div>
<div class="page">
	<p>Checking his retinal watch, which read zero five thirty, Kient stepped up to his boss and landlord. "I need to take the morning shift off today," he informed. "I'll work an extra shift tomorrow," he assured, "but something personal came up and I need to go deal with it.</p>
	<p>"Yeah, yeah, it happens," the mechanic said understandingly.</p>
	<p>"Thank you," Kient breathed out, relief evident, then sprinted out of the shop.</p>
	<p class="sectionbreak">***</p>
	<p class="sound">Bang. Bang. Bang.</p>
	<p>Blinking the sleep out of her eyes, Evelyn tried to locate the source of the sound.</p>
	<p class="sound">Bang. Bang. Bang.</p>
	<p><em>The door,</em> she determined. <em>Someone's at the door</em>. Stumbling out of bed, running into her nightstand, then correcting course for the door, Evelyn finally found the clock on her wall. <em>Zero five fifty three? Who is up at this time, much less knocking on my door.</em></p>
	<p class="sound">Bang. Bang. Bang.</p>
	<p>"Who is it‽ It's zero five fifty three, for goodness sake!"</p>
	<p>"Kient," came the reply. "It's important, let me in."</p>
	<p>"I never want to see you again!" she insisted.</p>
	<p>"It's important," he returned, still outside the door.</p>
	<p>"Are you going to help me find my family?" she asked. "If so, you can come in. Otherwise, get out of my life!"</p>
	<p>"I'll sit outside your door until you let me in," he threatened. "You're the only one who knows what I am; I don't have anyone else to talk with about this."</p>
	<p>"I hate you," Evelyn declared, opening the door.</p>
</div>
<div class="page">
	<p>"Being hated is better than ending the world."</p>
	<p>"Why are you here?" Evelyn asked. She'd been too tired to change when she got home, and wore the same, if more wrinkled, outfit as last night.</p>
	<p>"Has anything else disappeared on you?" Kient asked.</p>
	<p>"No… But… Why would anything disappear around me?"</p>
	<p>"Disappearances tend to happen in close proximity to the person who changed history."</p>
	<p>"I'm not a time traveler," Evelyn said.</p>
	<p>"No, but the key, if the theory is correct, is foreknowledge of future events; you've talked with me, so you can cause history to sidetrack now."</p>
	<p>"I haven't noticed anything disappear, though it's not like I've had time to take inventory lately," she said, gesturing to the still partially unpacked boxes sprinkled throughout the foyer.</p>
	<p>"It's probably me then," he concluded. "Given that a car stopped existing, something's dangerously off-track. If things around you stopped existing, they'd almost certainly be noticeable."</p>
	<p>"So this is your emergency?" Evelyn asked dryly. "Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go back to bed. I'll need a clear head tomorrow."</p>
	<p>"Wait! No, I need to talk to you," Kient insisted. "Another car disappeared; this time at the mechanics shop. If I don't fix this, I can't promise that it won't get worse and worse until the entire city goes poof! Maybe even worse! You saw the car disappear! What were we doing beforehand that was affected by my foreknowledge?"</p>
	<p>Swallowing her anger, Evelyn considered his question. "Would you help me find my family if you weren't so focused on not messing with history?"</p>
	<p>"Yes? I explained why I couldn't. Causing paradoxes by getting involved risks ending the world. Then your family, along with everyone else, would be dead, not just missing."</p>
</div>
<div class="page">
	<p>"So," Evelyn concluded, "your foreknowledge of the risk of interfering made you refuse to help…"</p>
	<p>"I think you're biased," Kient accused.</p>
	<p>"It doesn't make me wrong," Evelyn shot back. Seeing his skepticism, she continued, saying "I lied to the police because of what you said. You had ulterior motive for that argument, but it didn't make you wrong then, and it doesn't make me wrong now."</p>
	<p>"Fine, I'll help, but if things keep disappearing, I stop."</p>
	<p>"Thank you," Evelyn answered.</p>
	<p>"You mentioned that you had a contact, someone who could help you?" Kient confirmed.</p>
	<p>"Yeah, he's an old man named Kirk. He has fingers in everything that goes on in this city, and at least three others near here. I hired him when I was looking for you."</p>
	<p>"I'm curious to know what he had on me," Kient said. "Are you going to hire him again?"</p>
	<p>She said, "I'll have to take out a loan, but yes."</p>
	<p>"Okay," Kient replied. "There isn't any sort of frequent customer discount by any chance?"</p>
	<p>"Not with <em>Kirk</em>," Evelyn said strongly.</p>
	<p>"And the police won't help," Kient thought out loud. "I'm at a bit of a loss," he concluded.</p>
	<p>After a quick goodbye hug, Evelyn handed Kient the papers Kirk had given her. "We'll find them," he comforted.</p>
