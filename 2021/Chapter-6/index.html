		Evelyn nodded in thanks as Kient held the hotel door for her. Striding up to the front desk, Kient spoke. "Two bedroom suite, please."
	</p>
	<p>"Of course," the receptionist replied, naming a price.</p>
	<p>"Expensive," Kient said, whistling.</p>
	<p>"It <em>is</em> the Emperor's inauguration day," Evelyn pointed out. Kient grimaced.</p>
	<p>Taking the proffered room keys, they made their way to the third floor. Their rooms were modernly furnished, with an alternating mauve and teal wallpaper. </p>
	<p>Setting her suitcase atop the dark brown bed, Evelyn pulled off her shoes and socks, running her toes through the tight . She began unpacking, but made a stopping motion with his hand. "You have the list?" he asked.</p>
	<p>"Yes," Evelyn said, pausing, then reaching into her purse for her notebook. Before setting out, Kient had made sure they kept a running inventory of everything in their suitcases. Now as she unpacked, she checked every item off the list.</p>
	<p>"Uh oh," Kient exclaimed. "My toothbrush and a pair of socks are missing."</p>
	<p>"And you're sure you didn't just forget to pack them?" Evelyn asked.</p>
	<p>"Positive," Kient insisted. "That's why I had us make lists."</p>
	<p>"So, you said if small items start disappearing, we're a bit off-track from the course the universe is set upon."</p>
	<p>"Yes… or at least about to get off track. However, if that theory is correct, we're not in terrible trouble until bigger things disappear."</p>

	<p>"Comforting," Evelyn commented, plopping down on the bed. "I can't imagine the emperor not getting assassinated counts for so little. I mean, he has ambitions <em>and</em> the power to see them realized. His death, or lack thereof, will have huge impacts on history.</p>
	<p>"Not if the history books are wrong about when he died," Kient argued.</p>
	<p>"Is that possible?" Evelyn asked.</p>
	<p>"I'd call it more likely than the such a big change in history causing such tiny effects."</p>
	<p>"Yeah, but even <em>I</em> will say it happened today," Evelyn objected. "I don't lie in my articles."</p>
	<p>"I don't know then," Kient admitted, striding over to the bland dark brown chair next to Evelyn's bed.</p>
