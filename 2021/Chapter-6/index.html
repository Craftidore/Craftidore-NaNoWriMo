		Evelyn nodded in thanks as Kient held the hotel door for her. Striding up to the front desk, Kient spoke. "Two bedroom suite, please."
	</p>
	<p>"Of course," the receptionist replied, naming a price.</p>
	<p>"Expensive," Kient said, whistling.</p>
	<p>"It <em>is</em> the Emperor's inauguration day," Evelyn pointed out. Kient grimaced.</p>
	<p>Taking the proffered room keys, they made their way to the third floor. Their rooms were modernly furnished, with an alternating mauve and teal wallpaper. </p>
	<p>Setting her suitcase atop the dark brown bed, Evelyn pulled off her shoes and socks, running her toes through the tight . She began unpacking, but made a stopping motion with his hand. "You have the list?" he asked.</p>
	<p>"Yes," Evelyn said, pausing, then reaching into her purse for her notebook. Before setting out, Kient had made sure they kept a running inventory of everything in their suitcases. Now as she unpacked, she checked every item off the list.</p>
	<p>"Uh oh," Kient exclaimed. "My toothbrush and a pair of socks are missing."</p>
	<p>"And you're sure you didn't just forget to pack them?" Evelyn asked.</p>
	<p>"Positive," Kient insisted. "That's why I had us make lists."</p>
	<p>"So, you said if small items start disappearing, we're a bit off-track from the course the universe is set upon."</p>
	<p>"Yes… or at least about to get off track. However, if that theory is correct, we're not in terrible trouble until bigger things disappear."</p>

<div class="page">
	<p>"Comforting," Evelyn commented, plopping down on the bed. "I can't imagine the emperor not getting assassinated counts for so little. I mean, he has ambitions <em>and</em> the power to see them realized. His death, or lack thereof, will have huge impacts on history.</p>
	<p>"Not if the history books are wrong about when he died," Kient argued.</p>
	<p>"Is that possible?" Evelyn asked.</p>
	<p>"I'd call it more likely than the such a big change in history causing such tiny effects."</p>
	<p>"Yeah, but even <em>I</em> will say it happened today," Evelyn objected. "I don't lie in my articles."</p>
	<p>"I don't know then," Kient admitted, striding over to the bland dark brown chair next to Evelyn's bed.</p>
	<p class="sectionbreak">***</p>
	<p>Evelyn hopped out of bed, landing on the floor with a thump. She grabbed a blouse, quickly pulling it on, then banged on the door between her and Kient's suite.</p>
	<p>About a minute later Kient shouted a question. "Who gets up at five thirty‽"</p>
	<p>"It's important!" Evelyn insisted.</p>
	<p>"It <em>better</em> be."</p>
	<p>"Get the article I wrote!"</p>
	<p>When Kient entered, having quickly thrown on and polo and slacks, holding the article out for Evelyn. "What is it?"</p>
	<p>"Checking to see if I left myself a message," she replied. "Bingo!" She pointed.</p>
	<p>"The emperor's assassins fired into the balcony from the top of the Richter hotel," Kient read.</p>
	<p>"The hotel we're staying at, coincidentially," Evelyn noted.</p>
	<p>Kient continued. "A force believed to be the emperor's secret police worked tirelessly attempting to stop the assassins. To this day, I do not know what stopped the secret police, though my suspicion lies in the renter of room 323."</p>
	<p>"Room number?" Evelyn asked.</p>
	<p>"Yours is three-two-one and mine is three-two-three," Kient acknowledged.</p>
	<p>"So… if we're right about the history books being wrong about the date, and I'm right that my article is a message from the future, we, or you at least, are enabling the assassins by stopping the secret police."</p>
	<p>"Tentatively, I'd say yes."</p>
	<p>Evelyn thought for a moment. "We should go check the roof of the hotel," she decided.</p>
	<p class="sectionbreak">***</p>
	<p>Evelyn ran her eyes over the empty concrete roof. Flat, with a raised ledge running around the perimeter, the roof was a disappointment. "I'll go see if I can get my hands on the hotel records," Kient declared, heading for the stairwell.</p>
	<p><em>So much for my theory,</em> thought Evelyn, sitting down on the ledge, feet dangling over the street below.</p>
	<p>"Aw heck!" exclaimed a scratchy voice from behind her. "You don't have to do this! I don't know what your situation is, but <em>there is still hope!</em>"</p>
	<p>"What?" Evelyn asked, turning.</p>
	<p>"You don't have to jump," a brown haired young man insisted, holding out his hands in a calming manner. "Tell me what's going on."</p>
	<p>"I'm <em>just</em> sitting here," Evelyn assured. "What are you doing up on the roof?"</p>
	<p>Fingering his backpack straps, the man shuffled on his feet, looking down. "It's… I just wanted to enjoy the view is all."</p>
	<p>"You're a terrible liar," Evelyn accused. "What's it really?"</p>
	<p>"I wanted to come up and watch the speech, but I somehow locked myself in my hotel room," he replied, cheeks tinging with red. "You?"</p>
	<p>"I left myself a note to come up here," Evelyn replied honestly. "Now I need to figure out why I wanted myself here."</p>
	<p>"Do you have memory problems?" he asked.</p>
	<p>"Sure," Evelyn said. "Not an entirely accurate diagnosis, but easier to explain. You said you were here to see the inauguration speech, right?"</p>
	<p>"Yes," he confirmed.</p>
	<p>"How far did you travel?"</p>
	<p>"From out of the country," he informed her. "I'm Gerian."</p>
	<p>"Fief?"</p>
	<p>"Civs," he told her. "A police officer, to be specific.</p>
	<p>"I'm Evelyn, fief Net," Evelyn said, holding out her hand. He shook it.</p>
	<p>"Patrick," he responded.</p>
	<p>"Nice to meet you," she told him.</p>
	<p>"You too. Do you know if the emperor has any more speeches planned?" he asked.</p>
	<p>"I don't, but that doesn't mean there aren't any.</p>
	<p>Evelyn walked toward the stairwell. "Hey, if you're up here and a guy comes looking for me, tell him I went back to my room." Patrick gave her a quick thumbsup as she disappeared.</p>
