	<p>"I agree, she's too eager," Evelyn told Kient. She sat on the edge of his bed, facing the dark brown chair where he sat. "However, she already knows too much. Keeping her out may be worse than letting her know what you are."</p>
	<p>"I'm still not really comfortable with this," Kient said.</p>
	<p>"Greg," Evelyn said, referencing the other time traveler who'd caused so many problems for them, "threatened to kill Samantha today. In his eyes, she's already close to us. Telling her won't increase the danger she's in." Evelyn realized she'd started to lean forward, almost shouting. Forcing herself to relax, she continued, "Given what Samantha just went through, we owe her some kind of explanation. You and I may be accustomed to life-threatening situations, but she sure isn't, even if she handled it well."</p>
	<p>"Anyone I interact with too much, especially if we end up forming a personal relationship, gains the ability to change history, possibly ending it if she isn't careful. I don't think that 'ability' will go away. I'm afraid your entire life will be tainted by meeting me, and I am so sorry! I can't do that to Samantha too. You're right. Samantha's been through the grinder because of us, but I'm not willing to make that worse."</p>
	<p>"Baloney," Evelyn accused. "You think it isn't worth it‽ Heck, if I get permanently disabled—"</p>
	<p>"Permanently disabled?" Kient asked.</p>
	<p>"Legs chopped off or in a coma or something," Evelyn explained. "Our medical technology isn't what it will be in the future, and there's no good recovery options for that." Kient nodded. "Even if I get permanently disabled, it'll still be worth it. Ok, so I have to be careful the rest of my life so I don't change history," she acknowledge. "I still think I'm getting this," she gesutured to Kient and the hotel around them, "extremely cheap. Don't you dare be sorry for the adventure you've given me!"</p>
	<p>Surprised and taken aback by Evelyn's passionate response, Kient stared at her in silence.</p>
