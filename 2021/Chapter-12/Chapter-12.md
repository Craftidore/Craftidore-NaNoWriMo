## Chapter 12

Sunday, November 27th, UniYear 137 — Arc 3

"I agree, she's too eager," Evelyn told Kient. She sat on the edge of his bed, facing the dark brown chair where he sat. "However, she already knows too much. Keeping her out may be worse than letting her know what you are."

"I'm still not really comfortable with this," Kient said.

"Greg," Evelyn said, referencing the other time traveler who'd caused so many problems for them, "threatened to kill Samantha today. In his eyes, she's already close to us. Telling her won't increase the danger she's in." Evelyn realized she'd started to lean forward, almost shouting. Forcing herself to relax, she continued, "Given what Samantha just went through, we owe her some kind of explanation. You and I may be accustomed to life-threatening situations, but she sure isn't, even if she handled it well."

"Anyone I interact with too much, especially if we end up forming a personal relationship, gains the ability to change history, possibly ending it if she isn't careful. I don't think that 'ability' will go away. I'm afraid your entire life will be tainted by meeting me, and I am so sorry! I can't do that to Samantha too. You're right. Samantha's been through the grinder because of us, but I'm not willing to make that worse."

"Baloney," Evelyn accused. "You think it isn't worth it‽ Heck, if I get permanently disabled—"

"Permanently disabled?" Kient asked.

"Legs chopped off or in a coma or something," Evelyn explained. "Our medical technology isn't what it will be in the future, and there's no good recovery options for that." Kient nodded. "Even if I get permanently disabled, it'll still be worth it. Ok, so I have to be careful the rest of my life so I don't change history," she acknowledge. "I still think I'm getting this," she gestured to Kient and the hotel around them, "extremely cheap. Don't you dare be sorry for the adventure you've given me!"

Surprised and taken aback by Evelyn's passionate response, Kient stared at her in silence. He started to say something, but couldn't find the words.

"I can't deny Samantha that," Evelyn declared, "not after what she's gone through so far."

"Make sure she knows the consequences of this before you just flat-out tell her," Kient said, accepting the direction the wind was blowing, but still afraid of forcing the cost of this decision on Samantha.

"I will," Evelyn confirmed, hopping off the the bed, and heading for the door, Kient following. The walk to Samantha's room felt faster now that the danger was over, despite their slower pace.

Samantha opened the door promptly upon hearing the knock, nodding to Evelyn and Kient. "Have you made your decision?" she asked hopefully.

"Mostly," Evelyn replied. "Can we take you to a café?"

"My day is open," she replied.

\*\*\*

"Will that be all?" the waiter asked. Samantha confirmed. The waiter walked off to tell the chefs, leaving Samantha, Evelyn, and Kient at the corner table. Kient had confirmed the lack of prying ears, human or electronic, and Evelyn dove into the topic at hand.

"We… need to know a bit more about you," Evelyn told her. "I'm sorry that we have to intrude and all that, but it's a necessity if we're going to tell you." Samantha nodded.

"To start off with, I'm Samantha Docker." Samantha lowers her voice for this sentence, as she should, given "Docker" is the name of a duchess of ==Country-name==, and Evelyn vaguely remembered the duchess had a daughter named Samantha.
