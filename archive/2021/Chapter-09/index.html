	<h1>Chapter 9</h1>
	<p class="subtitle">Sunday, November 27<sup>th</sup>, UniYear 137 — Arc 3</p>
	<p>"You 'want in?'" Evelyn repeated. "What?"</p>
	<p>"Look," Samantha continued, her voice impatient and annoyed, stretched to its limit, "I've seen how you two are acting. It's either some sort of elaborate game or else you're secret operatives of some kind. Either way, it's a good deal more interesting than anything else in this city. Let me help. I want in." Her explanation finished, she shrugged.</p>
	<p>"I'm sorry," Kient said. "We're not operatives or anything."</p>
	<p>"If we were," Evelyn said, "aren't you afraid we'll kill you for knowing too much?"</p>
	<p>"Nah," Samantha dismissed confidently. "Whatever media claims, I don't think secret agents would kill without a really good reason. Murder is still murder, and you'd draw way too much suspicion on yourselves even if you managed to avoid getting pinned for the crime."</p>
	<p>
		"We're nothing like that," Evelyn said.
	</p>
	<p>"Then you won't mind letting me in," Samantha concluded.</p>
	<p>"And what if what we're doing is personal?" Evelyn countered.</p>
	<p>"Ooo, juicy!" Samantha said. "If so, I want in even more."</p>
	<p>"Well, you're still in for disappointment. I'm exactly what I said: a journalist writing an article on the emperor's inauguration speech.</p>
	<p>"Then what's Kient here for?" Samantha asked, pushing past him, and swaggering into his suite. She braked to a halt, staring at the whirring box on his bed. "What is <em>that</em>?"</p>
	<p>"Do I need to get hotel security?" Kient asked.</p>
</div>
<div class="page">
	<p>"No, no," Samantha assured him. "But… it's putting out light," she gestured, "light in the shape of words." Awed, she stepped back. "'Printing'" she read. "Printing what?"</p>
	<p>"Yes, Kient," Evelyn added. "<em>tell us what you're printing.</em> You know I hate surprises."</p>
	<p>Staring at her, eyes incredulous, Kient said "You <em>love</em> surprises."</p>
	<p>"Well… I hate <em>waiting</em> for surprises," she said, changing her argument.</p>
	<p>"Out!" demanded Kient.</p>
	<p>"I'm going. I'm going," Samantha assured him, heading out the door.</p>
	<p class="sectionbreak">***</p>
	<p>
		Kicking the carpet of her room, Samantha jumped onto her bed, screaming into a pillow. This boring trip was driving her insane, and she needed something exciting to do. She wasn't convinced Evelyn and Kient were the ordinary people they claimed. She wasn't sure why her mind refused to accept that possibility, but it's not like she normally understood how her brain worked.  
	</p>
	<p>
		Her balcony door slid open with a click, just barely audible. Spinning around, she spotted the source. The barrel of a gun bore down on her. "Don't make a sound," the towering nondescript man said. Maybe it was just because the gun drew her attention, but afterward she couldn't even remember what his hair color was.
	</p>
	<p>
		"How'd you get in," she blurted, albeit quietly. 
	</p>
	<p>
		"Not important," he replied.
	</p>
	<p>
		Brain kicking back into gear, Samantha closed her mouth, lifting her hands above her head and making no further sound.  
	</p>
	<p>
		"Off the bed," he commanded, gesturing with his gun.
	</p>
</div>
<div class="page">
	<p>
		Samantha obeyed, opening and closing her mouth, silently asking if she had permission to speak. He nodded. "Do you want money?" she asked, running through the possible reasons for his actions. "My wallet's in my back pocket."
	</p>
	<p>
		"No. Money is a tool, no more, no less, and there are far less risky ways of acquiring it."
	</p>
	<p>
		"Do you hate my family?" Samantha asked. "I know they have their detractors, but to the point of murder?"
	</p>
	<p>
		"I don't know who your family is, nor do I care."
	</p>
	<p>
		"I'm out of ideas," she admitted. "Why do you have me at gunpoint?"
	</p>
	<p>
		"Information," he replied as if the word clarified everything.
	</p>
	<p>
		"And you said you didn't know nor care who my family was," Samantha repeated. "I don't know what you expect me to know." Her heart was beginning to slow down, and her sarcasm began to reassert itself.
	</p>
	<p>
		"Do rooms 321 and 323 ring a bell?" he asked.
	</p>
	<p>"Kient and Evelyn's rooms? Why?"</p>
	<p>"What are they planning?"</p>
	<p>"Planning?" she asked. "Evelyn's planning to write an article on his speech, and Kient seems content to help Evelyn."</p>
	<p>Sighing, he relaxed his posture slightly but kept the point of the gun facing her. "Surely you've noticed they aren't normal people," he said.</p>
	<p>"Is anyone truly 'normal'?"</p>
	<p class="sectionbreak">***</p>
	<p>"<em>Please</em> tell me what you're making."</p>
	<p>"It wouldn't be a surprise then," he told her.</p>
	<p>"Fine. Maybe I tell myself in my article from the future," she said, grabbing the papers.</p></div>
<div class="page">
	<p>"Give me those," Kient demanded.</p>
	<p>"Nope, I don't see any hints," Evelyn announced before handing it to him. "I would just like to put on record how annoyed I am at my future self."</p>
	<p>"So noted," Kient said, grabbing the article. "While working on increasing communication with some of my informants," he read, "one source of mine was nearly killed; both the new and old emperor of Cabu manage it horribly, as is evident by the crimes present, and I feel pride in Geria for fighting such a despicable country."</p>
	<p>"My wording is awful there," Evelyn commented.</p>
	<p>"No, that's not why I read it. You say 'working on increasing communication with some of my sources.' That's what I'm printing: communication devices. This seems to be saying that a source of yours almost gets killed while we're making the comms.</p>
	<p>
		"My only source, save the new emperor, would be Samantha; we read each other's notes." Realization dawned. "Room 214," she said. "I'm taking the stairs unless you have a better suggestion."
	</p>
	<p>"No. I'll be right behind you," he told her as he frantically dug through his backpack.</p>
	<p class="sectionbreak">***</p>
	<p>"Wait," Kient commanded in a whisper. Evelyn stood outside the door of room 214, panting from her sprint. Despite her head start, Kient had beat her here. "I know you want to bang on the door and demand to know what's going on, but that might make the danger worse," he explained. "Besides, I think you'll like my method better." He raised a bulbous pistol-shaped weapon she hadn't noticed him carrying. Leveling it at the door, he fired, leaving a charred hole in place of the doorknob.</p>
	<p>Kient snapped a kick at the door, slamming it open. Squatting slightly, he advanced into the hotel room. Seeing Samantha at gunpoint, he found his next target. Before he could fire, the gunman twisted his arm up into a protective V, and blue energy laced outward, creating a shield. Kient's blasts proved ineffectual against the shield, gunman backing up to the balcony. He grabbed a dangling rope and disappeared.</p>
</div>
<div class="page">
	<p>"I don't think you can convince me you aren't secret agents or something anymore," Samantha commented.</p>
