	<h1>Chapter 1</h1>
	<p class="subtitle">Friday, November 4<sup>th</sup>, UniYear 137 — Arc 1</p>
	<p>
		Typewriter clicking fiercely, Evelyn finished the final draft of her article with a joyous exclamation of "Done!" She grinned at the annoyed look of Arthur. Arthur's stubborn insistence to wear fancy clothes, even on casual Fridays like today, always drove her nuts, and she felt vindicated finishing ahead of him. "I stayed up late working on this last night." she soothed, explaining her speed. 
	</p>
	<p>"What's the topic?" Arthur asked. "Don't worry, I'm not going to try and steal the idea and take credit."</p>
	<p>"Well, you know how the consul from Cabu left the country in such a hurry?"</p>
	<p>"Yup. Everybody's got a theory why. Listening to the more outlandish conspiracy theories is sheer entertainment."</p>
	<p>"I got a meeting with one of the secretaries up in the capitol, and she helped me understand what happened. It was a simple disagreement, plain and simple, not worth the hype everyone has given it."</p>
	<p>Arthur typed in silence for a couple of seconds, mulling this over. "You know that won't sell. We adopted you into this fief on probation, but if you keep producing boring garbage like that, there is no way Lord Edward will let you stay."</p>
	<p>"It's not boring garbage!" Evelyn almost shouted, stomping out the door.</p>
	<p class="sectionbreak">***</p>
	<p>
		Evelyn biked down the empty streets of Domel, a unihour ahead of the rush. The wind blew trash across the dusty street. <em>The Hiij desperately need more funds</em> she reflected. <em>I'll have to bring that to Mother's attention.</em> She had time to kill and braked to a halt in front of a quaint cafeteria. "Lord Hasting! It's good to see you," she greeted the chef, locking her bike on the bike rack.
	</p>
</div>
<div class="page">
	<p>"You're early!" Hasting accused good-naturedly, his deep, gruff, and scratchy voice in sharp contrast with his scrawny build, head peeking out the cafeteria stall.</p>
	<p>"I'm on time exactly" Evelyn countered jokingly. "I could never be <em>early</em>. All the clocks in the city must be wrong. It's the only reasonable explanation" she continued, laughing.</p>
	<p>"The usual?" Hasting queried.</p>
	<p>"Let's switch it up a bit," she announced, grinning. "I'll have the spicy pork taco today.</p>
	<p>Hasting handed her the taco. "I loved your article about the various theories of healthy eating. It was absolutely fascinating."</p>
	<p>"I had to fight my boss tooth and nail to get him to let me publish it. He insisted the scope was too small, and the content boring."</p>
	<p>"You could transfer to another Lord," Hasting suggested.</p>
	<p>"I'm still only probationally a member of the Net fief," she said sourly. "I need to seem loyal and willing to take things as they come if I want to gain permanent vassalship."</p>
	<p>"Net would be a fool to turn you away," Hastings countered bluntly.</p>
	<p>"No fief can avoid foolish infighting and at least some self-destructive behavior. Believe me, we Netians know all about the stupid decisions fiefs make; those stories always sell best." Evelyn said, scarfing down the last three bites of her taco, and returning to her bike.</p>
	<p>"You're early, far before you get off work, <em>and</em> you're in a hurry to leave. What's up?" Hasting asked as Evelyn unhooked her bike and started to ride off.</p>
	<p>"Interview to catch!" Evelyn shouted over her shoulder.</p>
	<p class="sectionbreak">***</p>
</div>
<div class="page">
	<!-- The point of this conversation is to throw out the idea of "the legends" of when humans had space travel -->
	<p>
		Evelyn sat opposite a sharply dressed man, sporting cropped black hair, and nervously glancing around the living room. Evelyn preferred interviews in neutral locations, like coffee shops or parks. When interviewing someone in their own home, as this man had requested, it felt more like an invasion of privacy. "Sir, are you all right?" she asked. 
	</p>
	<p>He nodded jerkily. "I'm sorry, it just feels like… feels like I'm almost betraying my fief by talking about this," he explained.</p>
	<p>
		"I'm not going to give out any of the details of how your new telescope works. I wouldn't trick anyone into betraying their fief; I'm a reporter, not a monster." Evelyn soothed. "What inspired you to make a better telescope?" she asked.
	</p>
	<p>
		"I was working with Darpan Comp's mirrors, testing how light reflects when I wondered if these mirrors could be used to focus light. That was three years ago." the inventor droned as Evelyn scribbled notes furiously. 
	</p>
	<p>"How is the new telescope helping advance our knowledge of the universe?"</p>
	<p>
		"Well, there are about 20 times as many stars in the sky as we thought, based on what we could see with the old telescopes. Furthermore, some stars are fluctuating; the light they give out varies," he said, voice growing excited. Springing from his seat, crossing the room to a cabinet, he pulled out some hand-drawn charts, displaying them to Evelyn. "See, they follow a sine wave," he explained, pointing.
	</p>
	<p>
		"Fascinating" Evelyn muttered, taken aback by his sudden enthusiasm. She let him drone on for another couple of minutes, before interrupting with another question: "Will these discoveries impact the greater scientific community?"
	</p>
	<p>
		"Not really," he responded after a long pause. "Not for a while, at least. Studying the stars won't be helpful until and unless we figure out how to travel among them as the legends tell of."
	</p>
	<p>"Thank you for your time," Evelyn concluded her interview.</p>
	<p class="sectionbreak">***</p>
</div>
<div class="page">
	<p>
		The Mechan family house, a large, luxurious domicile, surrounded by a gate and an acre of land, brimming with energy, stood like a mountain, looming over Evelyn. Disgruntled, defensive, and even angry interviewees? those she could handle. Her family? Dealing with them took real bravery. <em>I can't stand here much longer</em> she reminded herself. She took a deep, calming breath, left her bike on the lawn, and marched to the door. 
	</p>
	<p class="sound">
		<em>Knock. Knock. Knock.</em>
	</p>
	<p>
		After a few seconds, the door opened, revealing her lanky, shaggy-haired brother blocking the doorway. "We've been waiting for you <em>all night</em>," Flores, her thirteen year old brother, declared. 
	</p>
	<p>"It's only 6:15."</p>
	<p>"15 <em>long</em> minutes of waiting before Mom let us eat" he countered.</p>
	<p>"I was drafting an article on telescopes," Evelyn explained. "I lost track of time."</p>
	<p>
		"Family dinner night is <em>every Friday night</em> at 6 O'Clock, and yet you're late <em>every single time</em>."
	</p>
	<p>"I…" Evelyn stuttered, unable to reply. "Just let me in" she finally pleaded. Flores backed out of the doorway. Evelyn entered, shutting the door behind her. Shrill screams emanated from the living room; her two sisters were probably fighting over how to put together one of the mechanics sets her family had so many of.</p>
	<p>"You're late again!" her mother called from the kitchen.</p>
	<p>"I know mother. Flores has reminded me." Evelyn shouted back.</p>
	<p>"Redundancies make the world go round." her mom counted. Evelyn hated that phrase. Her mother took engineering too far, treating it as principles to live by.</p>
	<p>Evelyn strode into the dining room, grabbing a seat.</p>
	<p>Bringing the bread she kept warming in the oven out to the table, calling "Dinner time!" to the girls, her mom joined Evelyn. Her eyes lingered sorrowfully on Evelyn.</p>
</div>
<div class="page">
	<p>"How's the workplace?" Evelyn asked.</p>
	<p>"We've been working on a vacuum chamber. By Wednesday we should have it fully operational."</p>
	<p>"What's special about this vacuum chamber?"</p>
	<p>"It's larger than anything attempted before; about 3 square meters."</p>
	<p>"Would you mind if I interviewed some of the engineers on your team?" Evelyn asked cautiously, her mother cringing at the reference to her job.</p>
	<p>"Honey…" her mom began.</p>
	<p>"No, I'm not going to become an engineer; we've been over this. I love journalism, and I'm not changing course now. Even if the Net fief disowned me tomorrow, I'd keep writing stories. I'd make my own fief!"</p>
	<p>"You can't just make a fief. It doesn't work like that." her mother explained patiently.</p>
	<p>"I don't care if it hasn't been done before; I'll do it anyway." Evelyn shot back.</p>
	<p>"Can you please talk about something, anything, else" Evelyn's sister Enni whined, rounding the corner and slipping through the doorway between the dining and living rooms with her sister Ritti close behind. "Some of us just want to eat in peace, and we can't do that if you keep arguing all through dinner."</p>
	<p>"Thank you Enni," Evelyn said, relieved at any excuse to change topics. "Any new creations?" she queried.</p>
	<p>
		Enni straightened her back, face going serious, as it always did when talking about her engineering kits. "Yesterday I convinced Mother to buy me some resistors, I've been fiddling with them, trying to figure out how I can use them," Enni explained, "I think this will solve the battery problem I've been having; y'know how it would keep burning out and how I couldn't control how much electricity was being used? These should help fix it." Evelyn nodded. She didn't understand even half of what Enni just said, but that was nothing new; Enni and Ritti had always been brighter than she was, not to mention <em>far</em> better equipped to enter into service for the Gineer fief. They wouldn't disgrace their family as she had.
	</p>
</div>
<div class="page">
	<p>"And you Ritti?"</p>
	<p>
		Her quieter sister blushed. "I… I built a bridge that could hold five times its weight at once," she stuttered. "It's not that important."
	</p>
	<p>"It'll be important when people are walking on the bridges you've made because they don't have to be afraid of the bridge collapsing" Evelyn encouraged. Ritti nodded but didn't seem comforted. As the girls took their seats on each side of Evelyn, her father came in, trailed by Flores.</p>
	<p>"It smells excellent" Evelyn's father announced. He nodded in greeting toward Evelyn and her sisters before seating himself next to his wife.</p>
	<p>
		Dinner proceeded silently, with the occasional interruption as Flores or Evelyn's father would ask a question, trying to get a conversation started without success. Ice cream after Friday night dinner had been a family tradition for years, and Flores eagerly sped from the table when he had finished his food, not wanting to wait any longer than he had to. "Please scoop some out for the rest of us!" Evelyn's father called.
	</p>
	<p>
		Flores returned with only one bowl of ice cream. Their father sighed, got up, and headed to the kitchen. It appeared Flores had complied, scooping out 5 other bowls of ice cream, but refused to bring them to the table. Father returned to the table with the bowls. "How about I read to everyone?" he suggested, setting bowls in front of Evelyn and her mother, but carrying the rest to the living room. "You too Flores," he insisted.
	</p>
	<p>
		When the dining room was empty save Evelyn and her mother, they confronted the elephant in the room, the elephant her mother brought up every Friday-night family dinner. "I know you love to write. You can still write in fief Mechan." <em>This is a new tactic</em> Evelyn noted. When she didn't respond, her mother continued: "When a complicated piece of machinery is invented, the inventor can instruct maybe five other people. Those five people can train a couple more people, and so on, but it's slow and inefficient. If we had some way of writing out instructions: a user's manual, we'd greatly increase our efficiency. I normally don't reveal internal fief politics to those on the outside, but I'm fighting to implement this inside the entire fief. A test case—a manual written about some new invention—would be so helpful. You could write it!" 
	</p>
	<p>
		"I thank you for the offer. I really do. I'm not leaving my fief; I'm sorry. I pledged my loyalty to the Net fief and I'm not foresaking it!" 
	</p>
</div>
<div class="page">
	<p>
		With her declaration, Evelyn stomped out of the dining room, heading for the door. "You've left Gineer, shaming our family. What's done is done, but couldn't you at least have chosen a fief that actually furthers our country," her mother called after her. "Net journalism will never have an impact on the future! Not like Gineer inventions will!" Sighing, Evelyn closed the front door behind her, picked up her bike, and rode to her apartment.
