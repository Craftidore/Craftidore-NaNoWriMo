	<p class="subtitle">Late Saturday/Early Sunday, November 26<sup>th</sup>/27<sup>th</sup>, UniYear 137 — Arc 3</p>
	<p>
		Evelyn nodded in thanks as Kient held the hotel door for her. Striding up to the front desk, Kient spoke. "Two bedroom suite, please."
	</p>
	<p>"Of course," the receptionist replied, naming a price.</p>
	<p>"Expensive," Kient said, whistling.</p>
	<p>"It <em>is</em> the Emperor's inauguration day," Evelyn pointed out. Kient grimaced.</p>
	<p>Taking the proffered room keys, they made their way to the third floor. Their rooms were modernly furnished, with an alternating mauve and teal wallpaper. </p>
	<p>Setting her suitcase atop the dark brown bed, Evelyn pulled off her shoes and socks, running her toes through the tight carpet. She began unpacking, but Kient made a stopping motion with his hand. "You have the list?" he asked.</p>
	<p>"Yes," Evelyn said, pausing, then reaching into her purse for her notebook. Before setting out, Kient had made sure they kept a running inventory of everything in their suitcases. Now as she unpacked, she checked every item off the list.</p>
	<p>"Uh oh," Kient exclaimed. "My toothbrush and a pair of socks are missing."</p>
	<p>"And you're sure you didn't just forget to pack them?" Evelyn asked.</p>
	<p>"Positive," Kient insisted. "That's why I had us make lists."</p>
	<p>"So, you said if small items start disappearing, we're a bit off-track from the course the universe is set upon."</p>
	<p>"Yes… or at least about to get off track. However, if that theory is correct, we're not in terrible trouble until bigger things disappear."</p>
</div>
<div class="page">
	<p>"Comforting," Evelyn commented, plopping down on the bed. "I can't imagine the emperor not getting assassinated counts for so little. I mean, he has ambitions <em>and</em> the power to see them realized. His death, or lack thereof, will have a huge impact on history.</p>
	<p>"Not if the history books are wrong about when he died," Kient argued.</p>
	<p>"Is that possible?" Evelyn asked.</p>
	<p>"I'd call it more likely than the such a big change in history causing such tiny effects."</p>
	<p>"Yeah, but even <em>I</em> will say it happened today," Evelyn objected. "I don't lie in my articles."</p>
	<p>"I don't know then," Kient admitted, striding over to the bland dark brown chair next to Evelyn's bed.</p>
	<p class="sectionbreak">***</p>
	<p>Evelyn hopped out of bed, landing on the floor with a thump. She grabbed a blouse, quickly pulled it on, then banged on the door between her and Kient's suite.</p>
	<p>About a minute later Kient shouted a question. "Who gets up at five thirty‽"</p>
	<p>"It's important!" Evelyn insisted.</p>
	<p>"It <em>better</em> be."</p>
	<p>"Get the article I wrote!"</p>
	<p>When Kient entered, having quickly thrown on and polo and slacks, holding the article out for Evelyn. "What is it?"</p>
	<p>"Checking to see if I left myself a message," she replied. "Bingo!" She pointed.</p>
	<p>"The emperor's assassins fired into the balcony from the top of the Richter hotel," Kient read.</p>
	<p>"The hotel we're staying at, coincidentally," Evelyn noted.</p>
</div>
<div class="page">
	<p>Kient continued. "A force believed to be the emperor's secret police worked tirelessly attempting to stop the assassins. To this day, I do not know what stopped the secret police, though my suspiciona lie with the renter of room 323."</p>
	<p>"Room number?" Evelyn asked.</p>
	<p>"Yours is three-two-one and mine is three-two-three," Kient acknowledged.</p>
	<p>"So… if we're right about the history books being wrong about the date, and I'm right that my article is a message from the future, we, or you at least, are enabling the assassins by stopping the secret police."</p>
	<p>"Tentatively, I'd say yes."</p>
	<p>Evelyn thought for a moment. "We should go check the roof of the hotel," she decided.</p>
	<p class="sectionbreak">***</p>
	<p>Evelyn ran her eyes over the empty concrete roof. Flat, with a raised ledge running around the perimeter, the roof was a disappointment. "I'll go see if I can get my hands on the hotel records," Kient declared, heading for the stairwell.</p>
	<p><em>So much for my theory,</em> thought Evelyn, sitting down on the ledge, feet dangling over the street below.</p>
	<p>"Aw heck!" exclaimed a scratchy voice from behind her. "You don't have to do this! I don't know what your situation is, but <em>there is still hope!</em>"</p>
	<p>"What?" Evelyn asked, turning.</p>
	<p>"You don't have to jump," a brown-haired young man insisted, holding out his hands in a calming manner. "Tell me what's going on."</p>
	<p>"I'm <em>just</em> sitting here," Evelyn assured. "What are you doing up on the roof?"</p>
	<p>Fingering his backpack straps, the man shuffled on his feet, looking down. "It's… I just wanted to enjoy the view is all."</p>
	<p>"You're a terrible liar," Evelyn accused. "What's it really?"</p>
</div>
<div class="page">
	<p>"I wanted to come up and watch the speech, but I somehow locked myself in my hotel room," he replied, cheeks tinging with red. "You?"</p>
	<p>"I left myself a note to come up here," Evelyn replied honestly. "Now I need to figure out why I wanted myself here."</p>
	<p>"Do you have memory problems?" he asked.</p>
	<p>"Sure," Evelyn said. "Not an entirely accurate diagnosis, but easier to explain. You said you were here to see the inauguration speech, right?"</p>
	<p>"Yes," he confirmed.</p>
	<p>"How far did you travel?"</p>
	<p>"From out of the country," he informed her. "I'm Gerian."</p>
	<p>"Fief?"</p>
	<p>"Civs," he told her. "A police officer, to be specific.</p>
	<p>"I'm Evelyn, fief Net," Evelyn said, holding out her hand. He shook it.</p>
	<p>"Patrick," he responded.</p>
	<p>"Nice to meet you," she told him.</p>
	<p>"You too. Do you know if the emperor has any more speeches planned?" he asked.</p>
	<p>"I don't, but that doesn't mean there aren't any.</p>
	<p>Evelyn walked toward the stairwell. "Hey, if you're up here and a guy comes looking for me, tell him I went back to my room." Patrick gave her a quick thumbs-up as she disappeared.</p>
	<p class="sectionbreak">***</p>
	<p>"Hey," Kient greeted the receptionist. Confirming there was no one else around, and mentally reminding himself that security cameras weren't used widely yet, he slipped a large bill over the counter. "I need to take a look at the records of who stayed in each room yesterday."</p>
</div>
<div class="page">
	<p>The receptionist, different than the one who checked them in, glanced up, regarding Kient with her brown eyes. "Sir, are you <em>bribing</em> me?"</p>
	<p>"No,"  Kient denied, ridicule invading his tone. "I just need a favor, and felt that my wallet was getting a bit heavy."</p>
	<p>"Then you won't object if I take this without helping you?" the receptionist asked, trying to catch him in his deception.</p>
	<p>"Will you be pointing me toward someone who will help me?" Kient asked in turn.</p>
	<p>"I'm afraid not," the receptionist responded. "No one outside of the hotel staff and the owner may see those records without a warrant."</p>
	<p>"If it's a matter of how much," Kient tried, setting a second bill next to the first.</p>
	<p>"No sir," she replied, "more money won't make me more willing to accept the bribe." A door behind the receptionist's desk slammed open, a security guard marching through. Bill, according to the name tag, glanced at the receptionist, who pointed at Kient.</p>
	<p>Backing up, Kient frantically looked for a way out, before bolting for the door. Almost bowling a short man entering the hotel over, Kient sped through the sparse early morning streets, turning corners, taking shortcuts through alleyways, and trying to avoid being followed. Three blocks away, he slowed down, walking now, and continued another block when the smell of coffee struck him like a ton of bricks. Changing course, Kient entered. "An espresso please," he requested, voice cracking slightly, his breathing heavy.</p>
	<p>"Coming right up," the barista acknowledged, eyes focused on the nearby television.</p>
	<p>Kient pulled out the needed cash, keeping an eye on the street, then sat down in a corner of the shop. <em>What I'd give for an easy comm system</em> he thought idly. Realization hit him, and he pulled up a blueprint of an old comm system from the 180s onto his eye screen. Checking the materials needed, he decided he could cobble something like that together. He decided to finish his coffee first.</p>
</div>
<div class="page">
	<p class="sectionbreak">***</p>
	<p>Worry creased Evelyn's face as she waited in her room for Kient's room. She'd read through her article another half dozen times, trying in vain to locate additional hints. After leaving a note for Kient in case he came back, she took the hotel elevator to the second floor, which the hotel advertised as a cafe and hang-out area. Eyes assaulted by bright colors, Evelyn grinned at the scene. After ordering an omelet, she sat down in the common room across from a girl of about 19, half-cropped head drawing looks.</p>
	<p>"Nice hair," Evelyn commented. "What'ya doing here?"</p>
	<p>"I'm in town for the inauguration," she explained, hand unconsciously smoothing her black designer shirt, which matched her hair color perfectly.</p>
	<p>"Me too. I'm a reporter, so I've got a business reason. Evelyn, room 321" she replied, sticking out her hand.</p>
	<p>"Samantha," the girl replied, shaking it. "Room 214. I'm here on a school assignment."</p>
	<p>"Is your class with you?" Evelyn asked.</p>
	<p>"I've got a personal tutor, so it's just me."</p>
	<p>"Mind if we exchange notes on the speech? It's always good to see what someone else noticed that you didn't."</p>
	<p>"I don't think my tutor would mind," Samantha replied.</p>
	<p>"Oh! This is interesting," Evelyn exclaimed. "You say he kept nervously glancing up."</p>
	<p>"Yeah!" Samantha confirmed. "Toward this building."</p>
	<p>"Huh. I'll mention that to Kient," Evelyn thought out loud.</p>
	<p>"Who's Kent?" Samantha asked.</p>
	<p>"Kee-ent is a friend of mine," Evelyn answered, focus elsewhere.</p>
	<p>"Is he another reporter?"</p>
	<p>"No, he's a…" Evelyn replied, forced to contemplate what she was saying. "He's a guy who keeps an ear to the ground."</p>
</div>
<div class="page">
	<p>Samantha nodded. "I suppose you'd need to find information to exchange with some of your sources."</p>
	<p>"Sure," Evelyn said without processing what she'd said. "Look, I need to go find him. He should've been back sooner than this.</p>
	<p class="sectionbreak">***</p>
	<p>Spotting a youth stepping out of the hotel, Kient waved at her. "Hey, I need a favor," he called, discretely flashing cash. "Nothing illegal or dangerous or anything," he assured.</p>
	<p>"I don't do favors for people I don't know," the girl replied, nonetheless walking toward them.</p>
	<p>"I'm Kient," he introduced himself.</p>
	<p>"Kient… nice name. I'm Samantha," Samantha commented.</p>
	<p>Mouth agape, Kient stared at her. "Did you know you're the first person to pronounce my name correctly the first time?"</p>
	<p>"Look, you can't be surprised given how much it sounds like 'Kent,'" Samantha commented. "I can't claim credit for that though; I met a lady named Evelyn and she mentioned you."</p>
	<p>"Ev's all right, right?" concern invading Kient's voice.</p>
	<p>"Seemed fine," Samantha told him. "She was worried about you though."</p>
	<p>"I've been gone for a couple of hours now," he explained. "I'm trying to get back inside our hotel, but the receptionist has taken a particular dislike for me. I need to wait until her shift is over. I just need you to tell me when that happens." Kient explained. I'll pay you for your time.</p>
	<p>"I can do that," Samantha agreed. "I think 40 cabs is a reasonable fee."</p>
	<p>"No worries," Kient assured her. "I'll give you half upfront."</p>
	<p class="sectionbreak">***</p>
</div>
<div class="page">
	<p><em>Where are you?</em> Evelyn muttered to herself through gritted teeth. She'd checked their rooms, the roof again (Patrick was still up there, and confirmed he hadn't seen Kient), the lobby, even the common room. Heading back down to the lobby, she decided to check with the receptionist.</p>
	<p>"Yes, I've seen him," the receptionist's menace-laced reply came. "He tried to bribe me!"</p>
	<p>Faking shock, Evelyn stepped back. "How could he‽" Evelyn announced. "And here I was about to accept his offer of a dinner date," she lied, attempting to find a plausible reason to have been looking for him without associating herself in the receptionist's mind.</p>
	<p>"Hey, I need some help," Evelyn heard Samantha shout from behind her. "I'm sure your problem can wait," she rudely informed Evelyn, stepping between her and the receptionist. Jerking her head outside, Samantha mouthed "out there," before turning to the receptionist. "I'm locked out of my room," she stated. "I'm late for an appointment and <em>need</em> the lipstick in my room. The door is locked, and my key isn't fitting into the lock at all. I can prove it's me renting the room, just help me get back in."</p>
	<p>Backing away, Evelyn tried to reconcile this newfound chaotic rudeness with the sweet girl from earlier. With the receptionist distracted, Samantha pointed discretely to the hotel door, glaring at Evelyn. Shrugging, Evelyn obeyed, walking outside.</p>
	<p>"Ev!" a familiar voice shouted from across the street. "Sorry, the receptionist wasn't receptive to my bribe and called security on me. I've been waiting for her shift to end so I could slip back into the hotel."</p>
	<p>"I heard about the bribe," Evelyn laughed.</p>
	<p>"Anyway, I hired a girl to watch for when her shift ends," Kient said.</p>
	<p>"Samantha?"</p>
	<p>"Yes. You know her?"</p>
	<p>"We chatted half an hour ago," Evelyn told him. "But I think she just went above and beyond what you asked. Let me check." Peeking her head back into the hotel, Evelyn saw the receptionist disappearing into a back room with a shouting Samantha. "Now," she gestured Kient in, and they headed for the stairs.</p>
</div>
<div class="page">
	<p class="sectionbreak">***</p>
	<p>Shutting the hotel door, Kient rushed to his suitcase. "I've got this printer," he explained, "It can create anything of a small enough size, so long as I have a design and the raw materials." Kient lugged a large metal boxy machine out of the suitcase, setting it on the bed. Opening up his backpack, he pulled out some scrap metal and plastic he'd scrounged. Placing it inside the machine, he grabbed a playing-card-sized wafer sticking out of the printer, pressed it to his forehead, and inserted it once more. Whirring and purring, the machine came to life, lights blinking and walls formerly clear walls opaquing.</p>
	<p>"What are you 'printing,'" Evelyn asked, trying the word on for size.</p>
	<p>"A surprise for after I find Samantha and pay her the other half of what I promised."</p>
	<p>"How much did you offer her?" Evelyn asked.</p>
	<p>"Forty cabs," he said.</p>
	<p>Eyes widening, Evelyn muttered, "no wonder she went above and beyond."</p>
	<p>"Is that a lot?" Kient asked.</p>
	<p>"Yeah, about 120 rigs," Evelyn said, comparing it to Gerian currency.</p>
	<p class="sound">Knock. Knock. Knock.</p>
	<p>"I think it's coming from my room," Evelyn noted. Walking to her suite, she pulled open the door to reveal Samantha.</p>
	<p>"Your friend owes me twenty cabs."</p>
	<p>"Yes, he does. I gave him your room number, and he was about to pop down and give it to you."</p>
	<p>"Nice of him," Samantha commented, "but I'd like to renegotiate." Stepping into Evelyn's room, calling to the neighboring room "Kient I know you're in there." Once Kient joined them, Samantha continued, saying "I don't need money. I meant the whole 'forty cabs' thing to test how desperate you were. I wasn't expecting you to agree." She pulled the twenty cabs he'd already given her out of a pocket, setting it on the table.</p>
	<p>"I don't want your money; I want in," she concluded.</p>
