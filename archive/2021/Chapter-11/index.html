	<h1>Chapter 11</h1>
	<p class="subtitle">Saturday, November 11<sup>th</sup>, UniYear 137 — Arc 2</p>
	<p>Kient strode down the stairs of Evelyn's apartment complex, waving absently at one of Evelyn's neighbor's as she climbed. He gave a quick once-over through the paper's Evelyn had lent him. His eyebrows skyrocketed as he realized the detail of Evelyn's contact. Kirk, it appeared, had been able to discover some five times more detail about the first twenty-four hours since Kient arrived than Kient himself remembered. He'd managed to determine, Kient wasn't sure how, the content of every conversation between him and the various locals he'd engaged in that day.</p>
	<p>Shaking his head, Kient turned the pages until the writing style changed. This section, written in prose essay form instead of the stricter dataset feel of the prior, postulated on Kient's motivations. <em>More right than wrong</em> Kient concluded. The hefty expense this Kirk charged was likely on-par with the quality of his services.</p>
	<p>Reading a bit deeper, Kient found the paragraph where Kirk spoke about the the other occurance. Playing a hunch, he turned 180 and strode back up the stairs to Evelyn's apartment. Knocking on the door, he adjusted his armband, trying to make it fit more comfortably.</p>
	<p>"Hello again," Evelyn greeted him, confused.</p>
	<p>"What's Kirk's address?" he asked.</p>
	<p>"Why do you need to know?" she asked, curious rather than unwilling to part with the address.</p>
	<p>"I want to know more about this subject of Kirk's. The one who popped into existance just like I did," he told her.</p>
	<p>"Why?"</p>
	<p>"You saw how detailed Kirk was. Nothing slips past this man. I don't know how he does it, but if there's information to be had, he can get it," Kient explained, clearly impressed with the scope of the report.</p>
</div>
<div class="page">
	<p>"Yeah, he's good at what he does," Evelyn agreed. "That's why I'm willing to pay his hefty prices when I'm out of leads on a case."</p>
	<p>"Well, given how awe-inspiringly effective his methods of intelligence are, if he can't find record of a person before a specific date, I would almost find it more likely that the person in question didn't exist before then."</p>
	<p>"You're wondering if you weren't the first time traveler?" Evelyn asked.</p>
	<p>"Yes, I am," Kient confirmed. "Doesn't it strike you as odd that a team of scientists were focused so strictly on a human sized vacuum chamber? It's not like making one is such a huge boon for society, nor is it difficult compared to making a smaller vacuum chamber.</p>
	<p>"I hadn't really thought about it," Evelyn admitted. "Sciency things like that aren't my forte."</p>
	<p>"I'll take you to Kirk's," Evelyn offered.</p>
	<p>"Just give me the address," Kient insisted. She complied.</p>
	<p class="sectionbreak">***</p>
	<p>"Quite the mess," Kient noted, carefully weaving through the stacks of paper, stepping on wads of crumpled and thrown away documents. "A short time ago, a man popped into existence. Not me, someone before me," he stated. "I need to know when that happened," he declared to the still empty room. "I can pay."</p>
	<p>A head popped into view from behind a wall of paper stacks."That's a call I answer to," Kirk said.</p>
	<p>"Understandable," Kient sympathized.</p>
	<p>"I'll give you a couple of freebies," Kirk said. "Greg, the man you're refering to, 'popped into existence,' as you put it, two months ago." Kirk named a date. "He told me another would be spontaneously existing soon, and paid me to alert him when that happened. Each day he pops in and pays me for an update on your activities." Smiling smugly, Kient gazed toward Kient. "So how much are you willing to pay me to keep my mouth shut."</p>
	<p>"Nothing," Kient announced. "Thank you for the information, but I have neither the funds nor the inclination to silence you."</p>
</div>
<div class="page">
	<p>"Well, if that's how you're going to be, I might just be a bit extra detailed in my reports for Greg," Kirk threatened.</p>
	<p>Kient didn't bother responding, instead walking out the door.</p>
	<p class="sectionbreak">***</p>
	<p>"If I could have a moment of your time," he asked the short lady who had just opened her front door.</p>
	<p>"I'm not interested in whatever you're selling," she told him.</p>
	<p>"I'm not selling anything," Kient assured her. "I just have a few questions for you, Mrs. Shelly."</p>
	<p>"Alright…" she agreed reluctantly.</p>
	<p>"Who first approached you to work on a human-sized vacuum chamber?" She gave him a name. "Why did you join the engineering team?"</p>
	<p>"It paid well," she replied bluntly.</p>
	<p>"When was it first completed?" he asked. She named a date two months ago, three days prior to the the date Kirk listed.</p>
	<p>"Who," Kirk asked, "was the most… how to put this… driven, on the team. Was there anyone who seemed to view this as more than just a project, but something personal?"</p>
	<p>"Yes," she said, now skeptical of this stranger. "Look, why are you asking me these questions. What authority do you have?"</p>
	<p>"I'm sure you're aware that a week ago, the main vacuum chamber was smashed."</p>
	<p>"Yes," she replied.</p>
	<p>"I'm investigating that," Kient lied.</p>
	<p>"Officially or unofficially," she asked.</p>
</div>
<div class="page">
	<p>"Unofficially. I was asked to by Robert Mechan," he said, naming Evelyn's father. "He didn't want me to leave himself out of the investigation, so I need other sources who were part of the project."</p>
	<p>"Well," she replied, "that's about as close to official as unofficial gets. Mark Tiin would be the fanatic of our group. He's the one who kept demanding we finish earlier than our projected schedule." She gave him Mark's address.</p>
	<p class="sectionbreak">***</p>
	<p>Mark Tiin, stomach growling, opened his fridge, searching for a snack. He'd accomplished his purpose, gotten the vacuum chamber completed in time, and he wasn't sure exactly what to do next. His newfound riches, while more than enough to erase the debt he'd accumulated, left him unsatisfied.</p>
	<p>Pulling out the milk, he poured himself a glass. Grabbing a novel off his bookshelf, he stepped outside to read. The daylight sun bore down on him, glare obscuring the pages. Sighing, he basked in it, enjoying the moment.</p>
	<p>As bugs grew in number, Mark finally returned inside. Setting his book on the counter, he went back to his bedroom… to find a masked man lounging on the bed, wearing a black armband, but otherwise nondescript.</p>
	<p>"Well hello," the stranger greeted him. Mark broke from his trance, running for the door. The masked man snapped his fingers, and the door closed of it's own accord, Mark screeching to a stop three inches from the door. "Six months ago, you started building a human sized vacuum chamber."</p>
	<p>Mark's eyes darted around, focusing on the window. "You were always so fanatic about this project," Kient continued. He had crafted a mask, printing it with a voice modulator, changing his own voice just enough to be unrecognizable. Kient snapped his fingers a second time; a blue forcefield sprung into place in front of the windows.</p>
	<p>Kient's fingersnapping was, of course, just for show. He had a remote hidden in his left hand which he'd wired to the various traps he'd set about the room. Kient hoped Mark was beginning to think of him as some sort of wizard or magician.</p>
</div>
<div class="page">		
	<p>"I wonder," he said,  "why that is. After all, I've read about you, and you aren't really the passionate type." He had read Mark's report. The Net fief had created reports on most of the semi-prominent scientists, which Evelyn had conveniently given Kient access to. "What were you promised?" he asked. Mark whimpered.</p>
	<p>For the first time since Mark had seen him, the stranger changed posture. Sitting up, Kient stared daggers at Mark, the tactic effective despite Kient's hidden eyes.</p>
	<p>"I… I don't know anything," Mark insisted. "I was just told that if it got completed within a certain time, I'd recieve a sizable payment."</p>
	<p>"Uh huh. And how were you told this?"</p>
	<p>"I found a piece of paper on my counter. It listed the deal, and a couple of predictions about the future, all of which came true."</p>
	<p>"Were you payed?" he asked.</p>
	<p>"Yes," Mark said.</p>
	<p>"How?" Kient asked, deciding to play a hunch. "I presume you were asked to turn on the vacuum chamber when the others weren't around. Is that when you were paid?"</p>
	<p>"Yes," Mark said, surprised. "How can you know?"</p>
	<p>"That's all I need for now," Kient told him, ignoring the question. He snapped his fingers once more. The door swung open and the force field dissipated from the windows. Walking out the door, Kient yelled, "Thank you for your assistance."</p>
