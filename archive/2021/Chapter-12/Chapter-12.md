## Chapter 12

Sunday, November 27th, UniYear 137 — Arc 3

"I agree, she's too eager," Evelyn told Kient. She sat on the edge of his bed, facing the dark brown chair where he sat. "However, she already knows too much. Keeping her out may be worse than letting her know what you are."

"I'm still not really comfortable with this," Kient said.

"Greg," Evelyn said, referencing the other time traveler who'd caused so many problems for them, "threatened to kill Samantha today. In his eyes, she's already close to us. Telling her won't increase the danger she's in." Evelyn realized she'd started to lean forward, almost shouting. Forcing herself to relax, she continued, "Given what Samantha just went through, we owe her some kind of explanation. You and I may be accustomed to life-threatening situations, but she sure isn't, even if she handled it well."

"Anyone I interact with too much, especially if we end up forming a personal relationship, gains the ability to change history, possibly ending it if she isn't careful. I don't think that 'ability' will go away. I'm afraid your entire life will be tainted by meeting me, and I am so sorry! I can't do that to Samantha too. You're right. Samantha's been through the grinder because of us, but I'm not willing to make that worse."

"Baloney," Evelyn accused. "You think it isn't worth it‽ Heck, if I get permanently disabled—"

"Permanently disabled?" Kient asked.

"Legs chopped off or in a coma or something," Evelyn explained. "Our medical technology isn't what it will be in the future, and there's no good recovery options for that." Kient nodded. "Even if I get permanently disabled, it'll still be worth it. Ok, so I have to be careful the rest of my life so I don't change history," she acknowledge. "I still think I'm getting this," she gestured to Kient and the hotel around them, "extremely cheap. Don't you dare be sorry for the adventure you've given me!"

Surprised and taken aback by Evelyn's passionate response, Kient stared at her in silence. He started to say something, but couldn't find the words.

"I can't deny Samantha that," Evelyn declared, "not after what she's gone through so far."

"Make sure she knows the consequences of this before you just flat-out tell her," Kient said, accepting the direction the wind was blowing, but still afraid of forcing the cost of this decision on Samantha.

"I will," Evelyn confirmed, hopping off the the bed, and heading for the door, Kient following. The walk to Samantha's room felt faster now that the danger was over, despite their slower pace.

Samantha opened the door promptly upon hearing the knock, nodding to Evelyn and Kient. "Have you made your decision?" she asked hopefully.

"Mostly," Evelyn replied. "Can we take you to a café?"

"My day is open," she replied.

\*\*\*

"Will that be all?" the waiter asked. Samantha confirmed. The waiter walked off to tell the chefs, leaving Samantha, Evelyn, and Kient at the corner table. Kient had confirmed the lack of prying ears, human or electronic, and Evelyn dove into the topic at hand.

"We… need to know a bit more about you," Evelyn told her. "I'm sorry that we have to intrude and all that, but it's a necessity if we're going to tell you." Samantha nodded.

"To start off with, I'm Samantha Docker." Samantha lowers her voice for this sentence.
"I try not to advertise that for obvious reasons, but I trust you two not to try and weedle me for favors or to try and influence my mother through me. 

Kient glanced around, confused. 
"I believe she's saying she's the daughter of Duchess Docker, who oversees a sizable portion of ==country name==," Evelyn explained. 
Kient grimaced. 
"Heir to someone influential and powerful…" Evelyn muttered. 
"That's rather inconvenient."

"But if it's already happened?" Kient asks.
"I mean, she already knows quite a lot… I don't think there's a way for this not to influence the future, which means the future was always so influenced."

"But she didn't have a noteworthy impact on the future, given that you haven't seemed to have noticed her."

"Our primary source for this era is *your* articles…" Kient said. "That mostly just means you didn't write about her—or else your articles on the subject are lost."

"I could end up not writing about her intentionally!" Evelyn declared. "Like, *because* of this," she clarified.

"I'm sitting *right here*… and also very confused," Samantha interjected, breaking the trance of Kient's and Evelyn's discussion.

"It's worth the risk," Kient and Evelyn decided together.

\*\*\*

"Ok, so…" Samantha brainstorms, "if Evelyn wrote an article about how the king was assassintated, and then he wasn't, it would be a 'big' history change, right?" Upon confirmation, she continued, "ok, and if things disappear when history is at risk of not happening the way it's supposed to, why haven't things been disappearing after his failure to be assassinated?"

"Just because we haven't noticed anything disappear, doesn't mean nothing's disappeared," Kient counters.

"Oh? You're the time traveler, and thus the only way to cause these small paradoxes. Shouldn't they be happening near you?"

"That still doesn't mean I'd notice," Kient repeats.

"I don't think you'd not notice; it may just be my theory, but this doesn't seem like it follows any laws of physics. 
It has to be someone or something intelligent yet outside of time, watching this happen, and signaling you to keep you from destroying the universe or whatever awful thing would happen if you screwed up time." 
Samantha paused for breath. 
"Regardless of whether my theory is *right*, I have a far more reasonable conclusion: the king wasn't assassinated today."

"Right, he wasn't. That's the problem," Evelyn said. 

"No, like, he wasn't assassinated today in the past from when Kient lived; 
I mean that you lied when you wrote that article."

"Why would I do that," Evelyn objected. 
"I always stick to the facts."

"I'm guessing to signal something to yourself right now," Samantha posits. 
"Chances are, you didn't change the narrative much; it seems risky to completely falsify events. 
Even as the primary source for this era, you still have corroborating sources of events around now, yes."

"Of course," Kient confirms. 
"And we would have noticed if one source said the king got assassinated and none of the others did." 
Kient seemed to be picking up where Samantha was headed.

"So I'm guessing that the king gets assassinated anyway and there is no war," Samantha concludes. "There isn't—wasn't—a war, right?" 

"No, no; otherwise I'd have found an excuse to get Ev' out of Geria. The king dies, and his much-saner cousin ascends to the throne, immediately putting an end to the ridiculous notion."

"Isn't that far more likely than you not noticing the disappearances which must be happening?"
